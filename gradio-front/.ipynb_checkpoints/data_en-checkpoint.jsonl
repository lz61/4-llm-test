{"id": 1, "Title": "Maui utility may have compromised evidence in fire probe, lawyers say", "Description": "LAHAINA, Hawaii — The Hawaii power utility believed to have started the deadly Lahaina fire removed damaged power poles and other equipment from a key fire scene, potentially affecting evidence that is part of an official investigation into how the blaze ignited.Hawaiian Electric — which acted quickly to restore power on the island after Aug. 8 — hauled away fallen poles, power lines, transformers, conductors and other equipment from near a Lahaina substation starting around Aug. 12, documents show, before investigators from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) arrived on scene. Those actions may have violated national guidelines on how utilities should handle and preserve evidence after a wildfire and deprives investigators the opportunity to view any poles or downed lines in an undisturbed condition before or after the fire started, according to court documents, letters and other records obtained by The Washington Post.“If a lot of equipment is already moved or gone by the time investigators show up, that’s problematic because you want to observe where the equipment was relative to the ignition site,” said Michael Wara, who directs the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford University. “Maybe there was a homeless encampment, kids, or a power line down on the ground where the ignition occurred. But once you move these things it’s much harder to understand what happened.”In a statement, Hawaiian Electric spokesman Darren Pai said the company has been “in regular communication with ATF and local authorities and are cooperating to provide them, as well as attorneys representing people affected by the wildfires, with inventories and access to the removed equipment, which we have carefully photographed, documented and stored.”ATF usually responds to bombings and shootings. This is only the agency’s third wild-land fire investigation, a spokesperson said. Usually, the U.S. Forest Service serves in this role, but since the Maui fires were not on any national forest lands, ATF has become the primary federal investigative force.While the causes of the fires in Lahaina — as well as others in the Upcountry region of Maui — are still under investigation, there is mounting evidence that Hawaiian Electric’s wind-damaged equipment sent sparks into the dry, overgrown vegetation surrounding its poles.As The Post first reported, the utility did not shut off power in advance of high winds, though it said it took some other preemptive measures. Now, it is facing at least nine lawsuits for its role in allegedly sparking the Maui wildfires, including the one that destroyed Lahaina and killed at least 115 people in the nation’s most deadly blaze in a century.One of those was filed Thursday by Maui County, which is suing the utility for “inexcusably” not shutting off power despite being warned that high winds were coming, and not maintaining equipment and surrounding vegetation to “properly ensure that they would not cause a fire.”ATF investigators arrived on the island last week to help with “determining the origin and cause of the wildfires there.” But by then, utility crews had cleared much of the site near the substation off Lahainaluna Road and moved damaged equipment to a warehouse.Hawaii, unlike California, does not have a state fire agency such as Cal Fire that immediately deploys investigators to fire scenes to ensure evidence is preserved. Such investigators help to preserve important details at a fire scene, such as flash marks on conductors, or globs of aluminum or copper that might have melted and fallen into the brush below, experts said.Starting Aug. 10, a law firm representing more than two dozen Lahaina families asked Hawaiian Electric two times to preserve evidence, according to correspondence obtained by The Post. The next day, one of the utility’s attorneys replied that Hawaiian Electric’s main focus was the safety of first responders actively fighting the fires; displaced residents; and restoring power.The company said it was “taking reasonable steps to preserve its own property.” However, because so many local, state and federal agencies were on the ground to fight the fires and clear debris, it was “therefore possible, even likely, that the actions of these third parties, whose actions Hawaiian Electric does not control, may result in the loss of property or other items that relate to the cause of the fire.“Hawaiian Electric will take reasonable steps to preserve evidence but cannot make any guarantees due to the rapidly evolving situation on the ground, which also is not within our control,” the letter said.In response, attorneys quickly submitted a temporary restraining order to stop Hawaiian Electric from greatly altering the scene where it’s believed the first fire in Lahaina started, court documents show.On Aug. 18, a judge signed an interim discovery order, which detailed how the utility should handle evidence around the “suspected area of origin.”There is a process for how utilities should handle the site where it is believed a fire started. The National Fire Protection Association states that “the integrity of the fire scene needs to be preserved. … Evidence should not be handled or removed without documentation” and the scene cordoned off with tape or flags.Hawaii’s Public Utilities Commission, which oversees Hawaiian Electric, has yet to comment on the fires. It also did not respond to multiple requests for comment over the last two weeks on whether, through its investigative arm, the commission is conducting a probe into what might have caused them.“The commission has been completely silent on this whole event which is terribly frustrating,” said Jennie Potter, a former utilities commissioner who retired nine months ago.In court documents and letters from a Hawaiian Electric, the utility said it removed the equipment because the company does not “own or control the land or public streets beneath its facilities in this area.By Aug. 12, the utility had retained Munger Tolles & Olson — the same law firm that represented Pacific Gas & Electric, the beleaguered California utility found responsible for starting the deadly 2018 Camp Fire.To “preserve potential evidence related to the fire,” the utility said, it hired a California-based “cause and origin expert” — which also helped PG&E on several Northern California fires — that has been handling the removal of equipment to a warehouse.Many experts and financial analysts have been comparing Hawaiian Electric’s case with that of PG&E, California’s largest utility and one of the United States’ largest investor-owned electric utilities. It filed for bankruptcy in 2019, facing billions of dollars in liability claims for the Camp Fire and other deadly wildfires.California utility officials had also fined PG&E and SoCal Edison for altering or not properly preserving evidence after a fire before investigators arrived.PG&E is not the only utility that has faced legal troubles for removing evidence from a fire scene. After a disastrous spate of fires in Oregon in 2020, a class-action lawsuit was filed against PacifiCorp for the blazes. The case focused on the utility’s destruction of evidence, said Timothy DeJong, an attorney for the plaintiffs. In June, a jury found the utility had played a significant role in starting those blazes and owed plaintiffs $73 million.“The experts had no chance to review the physical evidence,” said DeJong. “As a result, much of the evidence about causation came from eyewitnesses who saw power lines arcing and sparking or starting fires.”Hawaiian Electric was familiar with PG&E’s troubles, filings show. Last summer, it noted that utility companies can be held liable when it comes to sparking or spreading a wildfire, and cited PG&E’s “$15 billion settlement” with victims as an example. “The risk of a utility system causing a wildfire ignition is significant,” the company wrote.Residents who live near where the fire started say that the power company reacted quickly. By the time Ryan Gazmen returned to his home off Lahainaluna Road on Aug. 11, he said a nearby broken pole whose top had snapped off had been fixed.The afternoon of Aug. 12, a Post reporter visited the area where residents say and videos show the initial fire ignited. In a dirt alleyway across from the Hawaiian Electric substation, there was a damaged pole lying on the ground, the top of it haphazardly sitting in some nearby trees, with lines coiled up and pieces of a pole stacked around it. Experts who examined the photo questioned why the material was left there without tags or being taped off from the public. About a week later, that equipment was gone.In comparison, within hours of the Camp Fire igniting, CalFire arson investigators arrived at PG&E’s transmission towers where they suspected the blaze ignited and assessed the ground, noticing the fire’s burned path, according to a report from the Butte County district attorney. “Looking up, the investigators saw a detached line hanging down into the steel superstructure of the high-voltage transmission tower,” the report said. They immediately launched an investigation.In a news conference last week, Hawaiian Electric CEO Shelee Kimura said that 400 out of West Maui’s 750 poles were damaged or destroyed in the wind storm and fires, and 300 out of 575 transformers were visibly damaged. The substation off Lahainaluna Road was destroyed.Data from Whisker Labs, a company that uses an advanced sensor network to monitor grids across the United States, found numerous incidents in the power grid late on Aug. 7, knocking out power. The power came back on at 6:10 a.m. the next day, the data shows, and then went back off again at 6:39 a.m. It was during that time that a fire sparked in the grass by the Lahainaluna substation, according to residents and the Maui Fire Department.A spokesperson for Maui Fire Department said that crews had contained and “cleared” the blaze around 12:45 p.m. Engines left at 12:47 p.m., which was “an appropriate amount of time,” he said, and there were two other fires burning on the island demanding their attention.At 2:55 p.m., several residents all recalled smelling smoke, and two called 911. The Maui Fire Department confirmed those calls and said an engine in the area was on the scene within five minutes. At first, firefighters had the blaze in check, but a gust of wind sent flames down the hill in front of them.That was the blaze that tore into downtown Lahaina, resulting in Hawaii’s most destructive and deadly fire ever.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/24/maui-fires-power-utility-lahaina-investigation/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 24, 2023", "Tag": "Ecological", "Keywords": "Lahaina Fire, Hawaii Power Utility, Evidence Preservation."}
{"id": 2, "Title": "Lahaina’s deadly fire has intensified Maui’s fight over water rights", "Description": "KIHEI, MAUI — Just up the mountain from Lahaina where so many of his friends lost their homes, Ku’uleialoha Palakiko recently walked through his family’s ancestral farm land, which is thick with tall dry grasses.“We live in a super dry area. It’s a tinder box here,” said Palakiko, a Native Hawaiian farmer. Nearby, he is irrigating plots of taro that are fed by a small stream diverted from the Kaua’ula Stream flowing from the mountain above, in a system called an 'auwai that is centuries old.“If we take too much water,” he explained, “the land is depleted. Then we rectify that by putting more water back where it needs to be.”He and other Native Hawaiians in Maui have spent years fighting for a greater say in how one of their most valued resources — water — is diverted and allocated. Now, in the wake of wind-whipped blazes that ripped through Maui, they say they are being scapegoated by Hawaii government officials and developers, who say water needs to flow more freely for fire protection.The day after the fire, the administration of Hawaii Gov. Josh Green (D) asked the state Supreme Court to relax stream flow limits in central Maui to free up more water for fire suppression. A high-ranking state water commission official was reassigned after a prominent developer claimed his request to fill a reservoir in anticipation of fires was delayed. Two residents sued Monday over the reassignment.Hōkūao Pellegrino, a farmer in Waikapu, said the fire and what he sees as the resulting blame game are being used to “undo all of the work that our communities have fought so hard and advocated so hard to do.” The result, he added, could undermine Native Hawaiian efforts “to ensure that our landscape is no longer that barren, dry, arid, fire prone region that it has become.”It’s long-simmering issue — with roots in Lahaina’s plantation days — and it has escalated in the aftermath of the deadliest U.S. wildfire in the last century.Native Hawaiians say they are trying to go back to a less-flammable landscape that was wiped out by sugar fields and other plantation farming, leaving behind open fields covered with nonnative grasses that serve as fuel for wildfires. Some also say they need water in streams for fire suppression where they live; Palakiko’s extended family lost homes in a 2018 blaze after nearby fire hydrants ran out of water.Developers say that some regulations have hampered efforts to fill reservoirs with water that could be used to protect Lahaina homes and subdivisions.Since the fire, Gov. Green has repeatedly highlighted the ongoing water conflict on Maui in remarks to reporters. He has suspended portions of the water code “necessary to respond to the emergency,” and has signaled he may further relax water regulations throughout West Maui.Green has acknowledged that using water for cultural purposes is important, but has said the “stalemate” over water policy has left dry areas of the island vulnerable to blazes. His office did not respond to inquiries from The Washington Post.The governor directly addressed water activists during a live-streamed interview with a Honolulu-based news site, Civil Beat: “Look guys, we just lost lives because we don’t have a water policy or a statewide plan that protects the land from burning.”He also has said that “people have been fighting against the release of water to fight fires” — a comment that has outraged community members who say it’s a misrepresentation.“In my eight years on the water commission, I never heard, in a single hearing, that testimony from anyone in the community,” said Kamanamaikalani Beamer, who served two terms on the state’s water commission starting in 2013.He added that the Native Hawaiian community around Lahaina “has fought for literally generations to seek justice and balance for the streams and the community and other usages.”“In an emergency crisis, we’re jumping back to old paradigms that didn’t work for that place, and that brought us to this point.”Although each U.S. state has its own rules, water is a public trust in Hawaii, a legacy of its days as a sovereign kingdom. The State Commission on Water Resource Management sets standards for the amount of water that must flow through streams; citizens can petition over those.The legal framework around water rights has “been one of the few tools available to Native Hawaiians to fight against the commercial forces that have been bearing down on the islands for the last 50 years,” said Jonathan Scheuer, a water policy consultant and co-author of the book “Water and Power in West Maui.”Lahaina, once a capital of the Hawaiian kingdom, has always been hot. But before Western occupation, it was an abundant agricultural landscape with lush wetlands. An inland pond surrounded Moku’ula, a tiny island that was home to Hawaiian royalty.Struggles over water management heightened with land privatization in the 19th century. Ancient waterways and irrigation systems established by Hawaiians were diverted for the sugar cane plantations that took over large swaths of land in West Maui. Sugar cane, which gave way to tourism in the 20th century, dried out the landscape. A dried up Moku’ula was filled in, and then later buried beneath a baseball field.“The plantations’ need for water, to water the fallow fields of the dry plains areas, required massive diversions that immediately upset the balance of the ecosystem,” Palakiko said. “And that we’ve paid the penalty of that.”The sugar cane planation Pioneer Mill in Lahaina closed in 1999, and private developers, notably West Maui Land, bought up many of those former properties and took over their ditch irrigation systems. Water from streams was diverted into pipes and reservoirs for new subdivisions.Over the past two decades, locals have battled with that developer and the water companies it owns, increasingly securing more water to bring ancestral farming back to life. Protesters that have assembled at new trenches dug by West Maui Land have been arrested.The state’s water commission has warned the company it would issue massive fines for over-tapping water systems. Some families who have farmed Kaua’ula Valley for generations have filed and won lawsuits over streams running dry and land title disputes.The latest controversy began the day after the fires. Glenn Tremble, a West Maui Land executive, wrote to the state water commission complaining that a request to divert water to a company reservoir was delayed for several hours after an agency official told him to first check with a downstream taro farmer, per regulation.Tremble told The Post that the company’s subdivisions rely on the reservoir water for fire suppression, and that the company issued a preemptive request ahead of an unpredictable blaze. In the moment, he argued, it was unclear whether helicopters could dump water on hotspots, like they did during a November 2022 fire in an area above Lahaina when the Maui Fire Department tapped company reservoirs.“Based on experience, we knew that flareups happen, wind strength and direction changes, fires spread quickly, our reservoir levels were low and water from our reservoirs is used by [the Maui Fire Department] for fire control,” Tremble wrote to The Post via email. He added the company needs to have water available to the fire department before firefighters need it. “We also knew that having water for individual homes for irrigation and fire suppression can help to slow or stop fires.”Critics say filling the developer’s reservoirs with water would not have helped put out the fire in Lahaina. The hydrant system in Lahaina is supplied by the county water system, according to the fire department. And high winds made it too treacherous for helicopters to pull water from reservoirs to drop water on hotspots, as they have done in the past.In his letter to the commission, Tremble acknowledged “we cannot know whether filling our reservoirs at 1:00 p.m. (as opposed to not at all) would have changed” the outcome. He asked to lift rules on water flow to fill their reservoirs in the area during this emergency period, and “other regulations.”It became a political controversy after local media published the letter. The water commission official was “redeployed” to allow the agency to “focus on the necessary work to assist the people of Maui recover from the devastation of the wildfires,” the Department of Land and Natural Resources said in a statement. The agency cautioned against suggesting the official “did anything wrong.”But the reassignment alarmed West Maui community members. Two filed a lawsuit Monday against the commission office and chair, alleging a violation of the state’s open meetings law. The Hawaii attorney general’s office said it plans to seek a dismissal and called the complaint “wholly without merit.”Tremble pushed back against claims that the fire is being used as pretext for removing water regulations. “In the short term, we have only asked for some water to maintain some levels in the reservoirs for fire protection and suppression, including irrigation,” he said in his email.Climate change has amplified the tension over water in Maui, with rising temperatures, droughts and increased severe weather events leaving Maui more vulnerable to wildfires.The pressure to build new affordable housing in Hawaii, where the cost of living is incredibly high — as well as the ongoing influx of new residents from out of state — has resulted in more development in potentially dangerous fire zones. Green, who promised to increase housing when he assumed office in December, declared a housing emergency last month that suspended several laws to ease building in the state.But resources are limited and the demand outstrips the supply on the islands, some longtime locals say. Several family members of Hawaiian community organizer Tiare Lawrence lost their homes in the Lahaina blaze.“We need the water to be available for fire suppression,” she said. “But we also have to factor in that we’re tapped out in resources in West Maui. Development continues to go and go and go.”Palakiko agrees: “That’s the most critical question that we’ve been asking recently, is where is the threshold?”Last year, after impassioned testimony, the state assumed responsibility over regulating water in West Maui, and opened up the process for public input. The local Native Hawaiian community celebrated it as a key victory.But in recent weeks, after the fire, Gov. Green said that he “foresees” changing or entirely eliminating that designation. “Under emergency rules, I have to do that,” he said during an interview with Civil Beat on Thursday.Such a move means that West Maui “will turn back into the Wild West,” said Lance Collins, an environmental lawyer who represents several families who have sued over water issues.“We’re only one week from this disaster. People are still grieving, planning funerals,” Lawrence said. “The government needs to focus on helping the families.”As Palakiko walked his lands, he looked out to toward the ocean, to the devastated downtown area of Lahaina where his friends lost so much and are now running community relief sites for the displaced.Immediate needs demand his attention, like putting tarps on the roofs in town to protect against any future rains. But he also keeps watch over the water and how it flows through his ancestral land.This water is “more than a resource, it’s kuleana,” he said. “A responsibility.”Brianna Sacks contributed to this report.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/23/maui-water-rights-fires-lahaina/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 23, 2023", "Tag": "Ecological", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 3, "Title": "A terrifying fire struck Maui in 2018. Officials were warned of a repeat.", "Description": "KAUA’ULA VALLEY, Hawaii — Burning homes have a specific kind of plastic smell, one Samantha and David Dizon know too well. So when it wafted through their windows on Aug. 8, they froze. Running outside, they saw the plumes of smoke coming from Lahaina and heard propane tanks exploding in the distance. They knew what was unfolding, because nearly five years ago, the same thing had happened to them.Around 11 p.m. on Aug. 24, 2018, something ignited in the dry, grassy hills behind their home in the Kaua’ula Valley, a West Maui community uphill from Lahaina. Howling winds from a passing hurricane helped feed that spark, sending what the Dizons called a “wall of fire” toward their unincorporated village, where about 50 Native Hawaiian people live on ancestral (known as Kuleana) land  that has been in their families  for centuries.They barely got out. In the chaos, David’s mother, Yolanda Dizon, fell, and flames licked her arms and legs. Trying to help his grandmother, David’s teenage son also sustained third-degree burns. Yolanda’s puppy got left in a car, and David heard her yelping as she burned to death. Firefighters showed up but couldn’t handle the terrain. Over the next 24 hours, crews would battle three blazes at the same time.No one died, but if the winds had been stronger that day, officials said, the ultimate toll could have been far worse. Even so, the West Maui fires of 2018 torched 21 houses, 27 cars and more than 2,100 acres, causing $4.3 million in damage and displacing a few dozen people, including the Dizons, who lived in a shelter for a year and a half while they rebuilt. In terms of homes lost, it was the most destructive wildfire in state history — until now.Five years apart, the two disasters eerily parallel one other. Both times, in August, hurricane-fueled winds pounded West Maui. Both times, they helped to ignite what would become multiple fires in overgrown, drought-stricken hills. The first time, the lack of warnings and chaotic evacuations spurred residents to question their leaders’ response, preparation and transparency. The second time, some of the same problems repeated themselves.A heated town hall on Aug. 29, 2018 — recorded on Facebook — captures the raw emotions five years ago. For three hours, angry and emotional residents peppered Mayor Alan Arakawa and other state and county officials with questions: Why didn’t Maui Electric shut off the power given the high winds and their equipment having caused other fires? Why didn’t emergency staff sound their all-hazard sirens? Why did firefighters lose water? Why was there not an evacuation plan? Why did their cellphones not get alerts? Why, after the fire, did the county not quickly provide the displaced with assistance, instead forcing their community to fill the gap?Now, in the aftermath of the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century, people in the Lahaina area are again asking the same questions, further challenging recent statements made by county and state officials that “nobody saw this coming,” that “this has never happened before.”“We were begging to be taken seriously, but our voices weren’t being heard,” Samantha Dizon said. “2018 should have been a wake-up call. But nothing was done here.”Despite promising they would take action, Maui County leaders did not make wildfires a priority after 2018, a Washington Post investigation has found, even though their hazard plan stated that “West Maui has experienced more wildfires than any other community planning area over the last 20 years.”The Post investigation — a review of hundreds of pages of county documents and interviews with more than a dozen people, including current and former county and state employees — found that Maui Emergency Management Agency officials regularly warned county leaders that their staffing and evacuation infrastructure was inadequate to respond to a major disaster. However, even with a budget boost, the county only increased agency staffing from seven to nine employees between fiscal years 2020 and 2021.The agency’s administrator, Herman Andaya, also did not act on recommendations by residents and others that the county broaden its outdoor warning sirens to include wildfires. At county meetings, he called the system a “last resort.” Emergency officials again did not activate those sirens on Aug. 8 to alert Lahaina residents of the approaching fire, a decision Andaya repeatedly defended before he resigned last week.The agency also never published its internal after-action report on the 2018 fires, which should have included findings on what went wrong and recommendations for improvements, according to a former county official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about the matter.In addition, the county did not broadly or swiftly act on calls by residents, as well as  reports commissioned by the community, to improve fire safety. At least two called for homeowners and private landowners to remove dangerous vegetation on their properties and create defensible spaces and fire breaks.West Maui groups and activists had been “begging and begging and begging” for disaster planning, including more emergency management funds and more fire stations, said Joseph Pluta, the head of the West Maui Taxpayers Association. In September 2018, the nonprofit created a draft plan to better prepare the area for disasters, using a state-provided template for residents. Pluta said the county declined to participate, so the plan never went anywhere.Back then, he said, he complained to the mayor and emergency management agency that they were minimizing the potential threats. In his view, there has been little political will to prioritize emergency planning.The hazard plan was still sitting untouched, in draft form, on Aug. 8, when Pluta awoke choking on thick, black smoke. He survived by only a minute or two, he believes, by jumping out his window. When he looked up from the ground, he saw his Lahaina home and his neighbors’ on fire.“Everything that we told them was true,” he said. “They didn’t pay attention to our warnings. They didn’t do what we asked them to do and minimized it, and now people are dead because of it.”Asked about the concerns of Pluta, the Dizons and other residents, Maui county officials did not respond to telephone messages or emails. Former mayor Arakawa also could not be reached. In previous statements, Maui officials have said their priorities now are helping fire victims recover, assisting in the search for missing loved ones and restoring services, such as drinking water.During fiscal 2023, Maui County designated $1.1 million for emergency management — nearly 85 percent of which came from grants — out of a general fund budget of $1.07 billion.While some Maui residents have criticized the county for not investing more in emergency management, it is well-known that such planning departments are underfunded nationwide. Many have just one employee. Local governments have also long struggled to fund and launch large-scale infrastructure projects and update building codes to keep people safe, the former county official said.The county’s small emergency response agency had issues beyond obtaining requested funding. The coronavirus pandemic forced the agency to redirect time and already stretched resources into the public health response.As for the broken and empty fire hydrants that hampered the firefighting response in 2018 and 2023, a spokesperson for the Maui Fire Department said the county water districts are responsible for making sure water flows to those hydrants and the equipment is functioning. Maui’s water is a complicated, hot-button issue, and crews are just the “the end users” of it, the spokesperson said. Water district officials could not immediately be reached.Hawaiian counties such as Maui take their leads from the state and depend on it for funding and direction, according to the former county official and a former state emergency official, who also requested anonymity to speak freely.While Hawaii is highly concerned about climate change, it largely focuses on sea level rise, flooding and hurricanes. Its five-year strategic plan, updated in 2022, only mentions “wildfire” twice, compared with 13 references to “hurricane.” And though Maui has a thorough wildfire section in its 2020 hazard mitigation plan, which stated that the entire county was “at risk” because of climate change, it didn’t prompt robust preventive work.The Dizons, meanwhile, never achieved closure over the fire that almost killed them.Yolanda Dizon, who was hospitalized for burns on her legs, arms and back, pushed for a probe of how the blazes started. In December 2019, the Maui Fire Department reported the findings as “inconclusive.” While there were power and high-voltage energy lines in the vicinity of where two different blazes started, the chief investigator said: “At this time, I am unable to rule out the power lines as a possible ignition source.” He was also “unable to rule out that this fire was intentionally set.”It felt like they were “sweeping it under the rug,” Samantha Dizon said, so Yolanda kept showing up and speaking about the fire at county meetings until she died this past May.“She knew something terrible was going to happen,” Samantha said of her late mother-in-law. “And that we were not ready for it.”Five days after the Kaua’ula Valley fire, Arakawa stood in the Lahaina High School cafeteria — flanked by officials from the county, state,  electrical company and police and fire departments — and addressed the packed room. The previous week, he said, had been one of the most traumatic ones he’d ever experienced.Listening now to what he said then is chilling, Samantha Dizon said.“We had three fires while watching for a hurricane. We could have had a lot of deaths,” Arakawa told survivors, including the Dizons. “We could have lost a lot of Lahaina and our tourist area, but instead, we didn’t.”The meeting quickly turned tense. For three hours, residents, including David Dizon, took the microphone and shared their grief and anger over a lack of warning, communication and post-disaster response: “You abandoned us.” “Where were you?”“You failed us,” Dizon told officials, and it wasn’t the first time, he noted. The community had faced close calls with fires in 2007 and 2012, and this time, his neighbors, the Palakikos, also endured a harrowing experience.That night, Daniel Kuulei Palakiko and his wife, Jaime, sprinted to wake up 30 members of their family as large embers landed in the coconut trees around their five homes. They quickly began to battle the fire on their own, cutting fire breaks and soaking the wooden structures. Fire crews could not make it to them, and hydrants ran of water. The last of their five homes went up in flames around 5 a.m.Commending them for their hard work, the fire chief confirmed that there had been a “break” with the hydrant. “I can’t tell you exactly why. We will follow up and see from our side and make sure we will have fire protections in place.”Next: Why didn’t officials blare their sirens?Andaya, the head of the agency, sat silently, so another emergency staffer took the mic: “Currently we don’t have a protocol for sounding sirens for fires, but it doesn’t mean it isn’t something we can look at.”Residents grew angry. “Just do it,” they yelled.And even back then, people had questions for and concerns about Maui Electric, which is part of Hawaiian Electric — whose equipment is strongly suspected of causing the most recent Lahaina fire. According to residents in the 2018 meeting, the company was responsible for other blazes as well.“If the winds exceed a certain amount, is Maui Electric required to shut down?” one person asked. “Those wires were whipping up there. And that was the cause of the fire.”“That was not a conversation that was had,” an emergency response official replied, asking the utility’s director of government and community relations to weigh in. At the time, that person was Mahina Martin, who is now the chief of communications and public affairs for Maui County and has been helping lead the response to the 2023 fires.Martin confirmed that the utility did not have a protocol to shut down power ahead of high winds. They still do not, as The Post first reported.There was, according to one resident, an electrical incident before the 2018 fire started. He then pressed the utility and fire chief for statistics about how many fires were the result of problems with power lines or distribution transformers. The chief replied that he did not have that information, but told him to submit the question in writing.The 2018 fire galvanized Lahaina and Kaua’ula Valley residents to take action themselves. The Palakikos said they spent hundreds of dollars on water tanks and hoses, and got trained on how to use them.Others showed up at meeting after county meeting, year after year, asking for better radios, evacuation plans and more emergency management staff:After Samantha Dizon lost everything in 2018, she said it felt like the county wanted her and her community to move on, and she did, in some ways.Now every day is like déjà vu, but worse. Most of the historic town that helped her family rebuild is gone, including the homeless resource center where they lived for so long. Many of the people who fed and clothed her have now lost their homes, and she’s the one organizing supplies for them. That’s especially hard, because she knows what they are in for, what the trauma can do.And then there are the dozens and dozens of burials still to come. Just recently, the Palakikos said they learned an older cousin, Jerry Junior Nuesca, died alone in his Lahaina home. They’re still waiting to find out whether he burned or choked to death.“You don’t move on,” from something like this, Samantha Dizon said. Because when you witness and escape a fire like she did, every whiff of smoke brings you right back to that smothering, burning air, to the panic and the chilling thoughts that you won’t ever get out of it, to the sounds you wish you’d never heard.Sacks reported from Lahaina, Hawaii; McDaniel reported from Washington.

Then the Maui fires came.", "Description": "MAKAWAO, Hawaii — Inside a barn, atop a dormant volcano on Maui, a pair of birds is building a nest. It’s their kind’s last chance to survive in our rapidly warming world.This is the ‘akikiki. This little, silver bird holds the unenviable title of being the most endangered bird in the United States. A grim census earlier this year found only five left in the wild on the neighboring island of Kauai, its native home.So here at the Maui Bird Conservation Center, their human caretakers have brought the pair of potential lovebirds everything they need to weave a nest and save their kind: fern hair, forest moss, cocoa fibers, even spiderwebs. Plants sprouting from high shelves simulate the rainforest canopy. An overhead water system mists to mimic the wet weather of Kauai’s forests.“It’s the last effort to save the species,” said Jennifer Pribble, who oversees operations at the bird sanctuary.But this landlocked Noah’s ark was almost struck by the wildfires that raged across Maui earlier this month. The fires are first a human disaster, destroying the coastal town of Lahaina and killing more than 100. Yet as fire approached the sanctuary, Pribble and others fought the flames and kept the birds safe.It’s just the latest way a changing environment is challenging this tiny bird, which even the most optimistic bird researchers are certain only has months left to live in the wild.In recent years, rising temperatures have expanded the range of avian malaria-carrying mosquitoes high up the hills, decimating the ʻakikiki and the islands’ other native songbirds.In one of the most ambitious species conservation projects ever undertaken, a coalition of federal and state officials and nonprofit groups is preparing to release insects with a special strain of bacteria into Hawaii’s forests to suppress the pest.Fighting wildfires, sterilizing mosquitoes, breeding birds: This is what saving species in the age of extinction looks like. With hundreds of thousands of plants and animals poised to vanish, biologists are pushing the boundaries of science to save wildlife before it’s too late.Perhaps nowhere in the country is the extinction crisis more acute than in Hawaii, which is home to nearly 500 of the roughly 1,700 plants and animals listed under the Endangered Species Act. Climate change coupled with waves of invasive species have pushed so many of the Aloha State’s native creatures to the brink that scientists have darker nickname for the state: endangered species capital of the world.Already more than three dozen ‘akikiki relatives have gone extinct. The ‘akikiki is next.The mosquito eradication plan, which will take years, cost tens of millions and test the public’s tolerance, promises to save at least the songbirds. If it works.Before it was a paradise for people, Hawaii was a paradise for birds.Far from the mainland, birds ruled the roost for millions of years. The only mammals capable of making it to one of the world’s most isolated archipelago were bats and seals. With little competition and few predators, Hawaii’s songbirds evolved into a kaleidoscope of reds, yellows and greens, filling nearly every niche with beaks of all shapes and sizes.When people — first Polynesians, then Europeans — arrived, they didn’t come alone. A cavalcade of cattle, pigs and goats trampled and devoured native vegetation. Feral cats, rats and mongooses, meanwhile, ate unsuspecting ground-nesting birds.For songbirds in the trees, the biggest invasive threat was also the tiniest. Mosquitoes carrying avian malaria began killing the islands’ birds, which unlike their mainland counterparts have little natural defense to the disease.For a while, the threat was contained to low-lying areas. It seemed like the songbirds high in Hawaii’s forests were protected by the mountains’ mild climate. As recently as 2004, ornithologists were “cautiously optimistic” about the birds’ chance on Kauai’s Alaka‘i Plateau, a damp and dense rainforest where temperatures remained low enough to keep the insects away.“We never had to put mosquito spray on,” said Lisa “Cali” Crampton, project leader at the Kauai Forest Bird Recovery Project.But soon, the bugs were swarming the biologists. Woods once filled with birdsong grew quiet. By 2012, it was clear the malaria-infected mosquitoes were getting to the ‘akikiki, with fewer than 500 left. Surveys showed it wasn’t alone, with the populations of it and five related songbirds contracting by two-thirds at the core of the forest.Appreciating what makes the ‘akikiki special requires seeing one alive — not merely as a museum specimen, the fate of so many extinct Hawaiian birds.It is an acrobat, flipping sideways and upside down on branches to fetch insects from tree crevices. Crampton took her teenage son to see one last year. “He’s like, ‘Oh cool, it’s upside down,’” she said. “People don’t see birds upside down very often.”With extinction imminent, biologists raced over the past decade to rescue as many ‘akikiki eggs and live birds as possible. The birds were safer at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance’s aviaries where mosquito nets prevented them from getting bitten.To gather the M&M-sized eggs, Crampton and her crew helicoptered into the jungle a 40-foot ladder and suspended it from ropes tethered below so as not to lean on the high, fragile trees.Capturing live birds is even harder. Rarely does the ‘akikiki belt out its signature song — a quiet eek eek eek after which it is named. Playing the tune from a speaker seldom brings out the bird.At the beginning of the year, the population was down to about three dozen. Even then, the researchers thought they had more time.“They were just dying as we tried to catch them,” said Justin Hite, another Kauai project biologist. One nest was blown off a tree by a storm. Another eaten by rats. More were just abandoned with unhatched eggs or dead chicks after the parents succumbed to disease.This year, when Hite heard the eek eek eek in the wild, it no longer filled him with joy. More often than not, it meant a male had lost a mate. “He’s blasting all around the territory, and singing and singing and singing. And it’s like, ‘Oh my God, she probably died.’”Across the ocean more than 200 miles away from Kauai, birdsong can still be heard in the Maui sanctuary.The San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance bred and hatched its first egg in 2018, and today keeps a captive flock of 34 behind metal doors and mosquito nets on Maui. Another 17 are kept a similar sanctuary on Hawaii’s Big Island so as not to keep “all of our eggs in one basket,” said conservation program manager Bryce Masuda.But with many of those birds coming from wild-captured eggs, the zoo alliance needs to figure out how to get them to lay more eggs and keep the flock going.In the wild, ‘akikiki are monogamous, building homes high on the outer edges of delicate ‘ohi’a trees. “They spend a huge amount of time just together,” Hite said. “So we joke like, ‘akikiki are for lovers.”To recreate that romance at the sanctuary — and foster more egg laying — the zoo built a bird version of Tinder. While some captive breeding programs choose pairing solely to prevent inbreeding, here biologists are letting the female birds pick their mates, as they do in the wild.Each female is given the choice of two males, one put on each side of its enclosure. Since birds can’t swipe, the researchers looked for clues of courtship: Some fed each other. Other flirted simply by spending more time near one another.The team found females paired with the suitors of their choice were more likely to lay eggs and had more eggs per clutch, according to a study published earlier this year.“We’re trying to play matchmaker,” Masuda said in a whisper on a tour of one of the aviaries in Maui, Forest Bird Barn II, in December so as not to disturb the birds, “and there’s no handbook or textbook written on how to do that.”Masuda and Pribble walked by a row of enclosures with a couple of pairs of ‘akikiki darting lightning-quick from branch to branch and peaking with their needlelike beaks in their food trays.One duo was already building a nest. “It’s a good nest,” Pribble said.While ornithologists untangle the birds and bees, a multiagency partnership is ready to stop the deadly carrier of avian malaria from reproducing. As temperatures rise, mosquitoes will continue to climb the mountains until the birds have no more refuge. The plan is, essentially, birth control for mosquitoes.The pill, so to speak, is a type of bacteria called Wolbachia. It occurs naturally in most insects, but there’s a catch. Male mosquitoes with one type of Wolbachia can only reproduce with females that have a compatible strain.So scientists are preparing to breed males with a version of Wolbachia incompatible in Hawaii. As early as this year or next, wildlife managers will airdrop mosquitoes by drone — first on Maui, then on Kauai.When the imported males mate with wild females, the resulting eggs will be unviable. As the incompatible insects overwhelm those in the wild, the mosquito population should plummet. The project’s name is “Birds, Not Mosquitoes.”“People have really come together to try to help,” said Earl Campbell, a project leader at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, noting the number of partners in the project and the level of support from Hawaii residents.But the plan, which is being rolled out by the federal Interior Department and the state of Hawaii, is as much a technological and logistical feat as it is a public-relations battle.As a longtime Maui environmentalist, Tina Lia wants to save the birds. But she fears state and federal officials are about undertake something too “enormous and experimental” on her island.“What else are we not looking at? Are there ways to do some of the alternatives that they already do now and really focus the resources on that, like habitat restoration?” she said.In May, her advocacy group, Hawaii Unites, sued to stop the mosquito release on Maui, arguing the state failed to fully assess the environmental risks. Among her concerns are female mosquitoes with the new strain of Wolbachia inadvertently being released, potentially allowing a new line of invasive insects to take hold on the islands.Proponents counter that kind of mosquito control, called incompatible insect technique or IIT, has been used for decades to fight mosquito-borne illness in humans in at least 14 countries, including the United States. This would be the first time the technique is used for wildlife conservation.“Mosquitoes are such a major source of human disease and human health problems that there are millions, probably billions, of dollars invested in ways to counter” them, said Chris Farmer, Hawaii program director at American Bird Conservancy. We’re “lucky that there’s been all that research on human health because we’re able to build upon that.”“I use ‘lucky’ with big air quotes.”The fact that some environmentalists like Lia are against the plan shows the battle bird conservationists have to convince some Hawaiians, few of whom have ever heard or seen an ‘akikiki. Its plumage isn’t the flashiest, and its song isn’t the most elaborate.“It’s hard for the general public to care about the little drab species,” Hite said. But doing nothing now means we may lose the “really, really flashy, beautiful” ones later.Now, the same warmer temperatures that have turned much of Hawaii into prime mosquito territory have helped fuel unprecedented forest fires in Maui.At first, Pribble didn’t think much of the storm on the evening of Aug. 7 that would lead to deadly Maui fires. She lives in a home at the sanctuary, and has seen strong winds before. But once she awoke to the sound of glasses falling off the counter, she knew something was wrong. Outside, the sky was orange with flame.A short walk from the bird barns, the forest was ablaze, with only the road separating the fire from the stretch of the dry grass in front of the bird center’s entrance.When she and a neighbor took a closer look, they saw the flames had jumped the road. It would only take minutes to reach the aviaries. There was no time to evacuate the birds.“Oh my God, this can’t be happening,” she recalled thinking. She told herself: “We can’t let this fire cross the road.” Pribble ran to grab fire extinguishers to hold off the flames, exhausting four in total. The pair unwound a water hose to further douse the flames.Once a fire crew arrived, Pribble assessed the damage. Fallen limbs and strong winds punctured holes in the protective mosquito netting. A tree had crashed into the side of Forest Bird Barn II.Staff members used chain saws to cut their way up the road to join Pribble and begin mending the nets. In the damaged bird barn, her team boxed nine ‘akikiki and one palila, a related bird, up in crates to transport them to an undamaged aviary on-site in case more trees fell. Like lifeboats on a ship, each building is stocked with enough boxes to move each bird in emergencies.All the birds were unscathed by the storm. But the ‘akikiki isn’t saved yet. It’s still waiting for its chance to fly free in the wild again.“Our primary concern is just making sure that these birds are thriving in our care.” Pribble said. “If we don’t do an appropriate job of getting these birds to thrive in our care, then there’s no chance.”This article is part of Animalia, a column exploring the strange and fascinating world of animals and the ways in which we appreciate, imperil and depend on them.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/21/maui-birds-wildfires/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 21, 2023", "Tag": "Ecological", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 6, "Title": "The chaotic efforts to search for loved ones still missing after Maui’s wildfire", "Description": "LAHAINA, Hawaii — It was well past 10 p.m. when Kimo Coston began an hours-long journey driving up and down a nine-mile strip of Maui’s western coast. He pulled his car off the highway every so often to stop where people were gathered. At each place, he asked the same question: Had anyone seen his aunt?The deadliest wildfire in modern U.S. history had razed Lahaina just three days earlier, reducing his aunt’s home in the historic seaside town to rubble. No one had heard from the 71-year-old since before the fire.“Nobody had answers — no one can give answers,” said Coston, 28. “I was just trying to do my best.”Coston is among countless people who have spent the past week and a half desperately seeking news about loved ones still unaccounted for. Some official channels have been established to help families. Maui County set up a family assistance center, urging people to bring information or provide DNA samples that could help with locating the missing, and the Red Cross has received and processed hundreds of reunification requests.But official efforts to determine the status of the missing have been slow going, and for people without power, cell signal or transportation, those efforts have been out of reach. What’s left, for many, is chaos and uncertainty — a tense waiting game for news and a patchwork of efforts to glean even the barest of details about relatives, friends, neighbors and co-workers: Are they missing or found? Dead or alive?After several days of searching, Coston’s hope started to wane. A sinking feeling set in.On Wednesday his fears were confirmed: Maui County listed his aunt as one of the handful of victims who had been officially identified.But many locals still waiting for clarity have taken matters into their own hands, some beginning their search through wreckage while the ground was still smoldering. Others have frequented shelters and community relief hubs that opened in the aftermath of the fire. Fliers for missing residents paper communities in and around Lahaina. Crowdsourced digital spreadsheets trying to track people are circulating online. Appeals for information are scrawled on dozens of sticky notes left outside an evacuation center. But as authorities continue the painstaking work of locating the missing and identifying the dead, residents told The Washington Post that clear information has been hard to come by.“A lot of us don’t even know who to go to, who to turn to to ask for these things,” Kekai Keahi, a local community leader, said Friday in Lahaina. “Communication between the people and the government has been real sparse and at times contentious.”On one recent afternoon, Kosi Preston, 32, wandered around a sprawling gymnasium-turned-shelter in Wailuku looking for his father. He hadn’t heard from him or his father’s wife since the fire.“I’ve called at least 20 times, back to back. There’s been no answer. I just stopped calling,” Preston said. “I came here to just see if they’re here.”They weren’t.“I don’t know what to do next. What is there to do next?” he said. “There’s nowhere to really look. How do you look?”“There’s nothing I can do,” he said, shaking his head.It could take weeks or even months for people to receive official word about their loved ones. Finding and correctly identifying remains after a destructive fire is an arduous and complex undertaking. In Northern California, officials were still identifying some victims months after the 2018 Camp Fire ravaged the town of Paradise, claiming at least 85 lives.Now more than a week after the fire wrought devastation on western Maui, it remains unclear exactly how many people are still unaccounted for — and many residents continue to struggle to find reliable sources of information about their loved ones.Officials are working to provide people with answers, said Adam Weintraub, a spokesperson for the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.“Any time you’ve got a situation where there’s no communication, disrupted transportation, those lead to breakdowns in information sharing as well,” he said. As the situation on the ground improves and additional resources come into Maui, officials are focused on “trying to develop a little more organization.”The county, in conjunction with the Maui Emergency Management Agency, established a family assistance center in Kahului on Aug. 10 — two days after the fire began — to help with efforts to locate anyone missing. People were asked to fill out forms and provide DNA samples to help in the search. But Coston and other residents interviewed by The Post said they never made it to the center in Kahului, more than 20 miles from Lahaina.Some had never heard of it. Others said they prefer to lean on trusted community networks for help.Maui County did not respond to multiple requests for comment, nor have they provided an official count of the number of missing people registered. On Friday, the government-led assistance site moved to a hotel about four miles up the road from Lahaina.Since the wildfire began, the Red Cross has received more than 2,500 reunification requests and more than 880 of those have been successfully completed, according to a spokesperson for the aid organization.While the Red Cross has been trying to compile a usable list of people, Weintraub said there are still “a lot of gaps.”“We’re not confident that the data quality is where we would like it to be if we’re going to use it as an official list for guiding reunification efforts,” he said, adding that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is now also helping with identifying and locating missing individuals.In the meantime, many have turned to unofficial community-organized databases amid the frantic search for information.Ellie Erickson, a Maui resident who launched one of the Google spreadsheets being used to help keep track of people, said the database was an effort to create a centralized location on the status of the missing. She said she counts herself as lucky, but in early days, as she worried about friends and co-workers on the west side, she said she started the list to help others share information on who they were looking for, and create a resource they could check for updates.The database is an “independent, volunteer-led effort,” Erickson said, noting that a large group of people are helping to monitor the list and update the information. However, she said they are not coordinating with the county or state.For some residents, though, accessing these online lists has been difficult because of unreliable cell service and internet connections.Cory Javellana, who lives just north of Lahaina, said he tried to access one of the crowdsourced databases five or six times.“The hard part is we get no internet to actually search through that list,” Javellana said.In the days before he knew his aunt had been killed in the fire, Coston said his cell signal also remained too sporadic to regularly check the spreadsheets. During the brief moments with connection, a quick glance at the document left him without answers.He would continue to scour Lahaina and its surrounding areas. His family in central Maui ran from shelter to shelter, hoping to find her amid the displaced masses. They circulated a flier detailing her features, highlighting the gold cross she wore around her neck.Coston soon wondered whether it made sense to run around trying to find his aunt — instead he became a fixture at the relief hub in Napili Plaza. At least there, he could be of service to others, and maybe, just maybe, he would see her walking by.But Coston, like others who have yet to hear from loved ones, described a grim feeling of acceptance that grew as more time passed: “She was probably in the fire.”", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/20/maui-wildfires-missing-people-lahaina/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 20, 2023", "Tag": "Ecological", "Keywords": "1. wildfire\n  2. missing persons\n  3. chaos"}
{"id": 7, "Title": "As Syria burns, and its economy collapses, firefighters appeal for support", "Description": "BEIRUT — Earlier this month, as fires raged across Syria’s Mediterranean coast, President Bashar al-Assad visited firefighters in the northern countryside of Latakia, a government stronghold.“You have made great efforts in very difficult circumstances that can be likened to the battles that were taking place,” Assad told them, referring to the country’s devastating decade-long civil war. “There’s terrorists and real battles, and there’s the weather and the wind itself maneuvering forces from side to side.”The fires sweeping across northwestern Syria this summer have compounded a dire humanitarian situation. The region, still reeling from two massive earthquakes in February and a grinding economic crisis, remains divided among rival factions and isolated from the world. Firefighters on both sides of the conflict are now trying to confront a common enemy, but are hobbled by a lack of support from the government and the international community.In earthquake-battered Syria, a desperate wait for help that never cameThe fires started in late July, the latest in a series of blazes across the Mediterranean, from Greece to Algeria. A transformer explosion ignited the fires, according to a local forestry expert in Latakia, who spoke to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity for fear of government reprisal. Heat waves, low humidity and strong winds allowed the flames to spread quickly across the pine-covered mountains and sparked other fires in neighboring Idlib and Hama provinces.Husam Zelito, 47, has fought fires for more than 20 years in and around Idlib. A government firefighter before the war, he is now a member of Syrian Civil Defense, better known as the “White Helmets,” a group of aid workers and first responders that operates in rebel-held areas.“Forest fires are the most challenging, and where we are struggling a lot,” he told The Post. “The human resources are there, but we need special vehicles that can cover the steep slopes and roads. Our trucks cannot reach some areas, and this slows the response time.”At least 17 people have died in fires this year, according to the White Helmets, including 13 children. Nearly 80 people have been injured.Even in government-held Latakia, war and Western sanctions have depleted local resources, the forestry expert said: In 2011, “we had around 550 firetrucks. Now there are less than 140, and they lack maintenance.”The government’s stranglehold on information has made it difficult to determine the extent of the fire damage. Early reports said at least 370 acres had been burned; weeks later, no updated figures have been released. Latakia’s governor, Amer Hilal, has formed a committee to assess the full impact. No deaths have been reported in government areas.“We have to wait a bit before getting a precise estimate,” the expert in Latakia said, but there’s “massive destruction — the forests are intertwined with a lot of agricultural lands and farms. People had to leave their homes.”The director of Latakia’s agriculture department, Bassem Doba, told state media that extinguishing the fires has been especially difficult because the affected area is still littered with land mines.But government media has stressed that the situation is under control, and has published a few photos of the fires. Pictures from Assad’s visit to Latakia show him surrounded by firefighters. Charred trees are visible in the background.On its Facebook page, the Latakia Fire Brigade thanked Assad for his visit but asked him to raise the profile “of firefighters’ work in Syria ... which is considered one of the lowest among government.”In a rare critique, Thaer al-Hassan, head of the fire brigade in Hama, east of Latakia, told the government-aligned Al Watan newspaper that firefighters should receive higher salaries, noting that sanitation workers are better-paid.High turnover has reduced the Hama brigade to 97 firefighters, Hassan said previously, noting that at least 60 more men were needed. In addition to forest fires, he said, the crews routinely have to put out tanker fires and are often attacked by rebel fighters.Frustration has been building for years as fire seasons get longer and more intense. Muhammad Debsawy, another fire captain in Hama, put it bluntly last year: “It is unreasonable for a firefighter to be exposed to fire and toxic gases while extinguishing a blaze, and to only receive a monthly compensation of 290 Syrian pounds, which is not enough to buy falafel.”National officials doubled salaries for government workers this week, but the decision was accompanied by an increase in fuel prices.Saudi Arabia mends ties with Syria as part of regional diplomatic spreeThough Syria was readmitted to the Arab League in May and has recently normalized relations with a number of its formerly adversarial neighbors, those moves have done little to slow the collapse of its economy. At the beginning of the year, one U.S. dollar was equivalent to 6,650 Syrian pounds; the figure now is 14,300.Ninety percent of Syrians are living in poverty. Last year, 14.6 million people needed humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations, more than at any point during the course of the war.In Idlib, home to nearly 2.9 million people displaced by the conflict, firefighting falls to the White Helmets, who are also responsible for responding to government airstrikes and other emergencies. This year alone, they say, they’ve been called to nearly 2,000 fires.“Sometimes in one day you have five to seven fires,” Zelito said. “In some other countries, maybe they would have asked for international support. The vegetation cover is becoming more and more scarce year after year, and the green areas are decreasing.”George Mitri, a professor at Lebanon’s University of Balamand, echoed Zelito, saying conditions are ripe for further spread. As climate change fuels recurring fires in the region, he said, they will be increasingly hard to control.“This is where we start losing the biodiversity on the site, because it cannot recover easily after two fires within a relatively short period of time,” he said. “So it burns again and again.”", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/08/19/syria-fires-latakia-idlib-assad/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 19, 2023", "Tag": "Ecological", "Keywords": "Keywords: Syria, wildfires, conflict."}
{"id": 8, "Title": "Sleeping in cars and tents, Maui fire survivors are unsure what to do next", "Description": "LAHAINA, Hawaii — Every day, they swim in the ocean. Every night, they sleep on the beach.In between, Peter Friedgen and Dan Reardon face whatever the day offers for two men cast away by the wildfire that wiped out the Lahaina pawnshop where they lived and worked. The sign at Hanakaoʻo Park says “no camping,” but nobody is hassling them.They are both 66 years old. And you can tell they have weathered other storms.Their spot in the world now is a gray tarp on the sand held down by stones. Behind them, there is a cemetery, and beyond that the highway — where soldiers and ambulances drive past — and the neighborhoods where workers in protective gear search for the dead. In front of them is open water and the island of Molokai rising in the distance.Over that stretch of water, boats have come with supplies that Friedgen and Reardon have helped unload. In the evenings, they have watched the helicopters make passes again and again, their spotlights scanning for bodies. But there are a lot of empty hours, now, a week after the disaster.“I feel like I should be doing something,” Friedgen said. “But what should I do?”The effort to house and feed the thousands of people displaced from Lahaina has consumed Maui over the past week, and many have found refuge in shelters and hotels or been taken in by friends and relatives. There are also those who are still marooned, sleeping in cars and tents along the coast. Others are living in churches and golf clubs as they begin to think about what will come next.On Wednesday morning, authorities lifted the roadblocks that had prohibited access to West Maui, but before that, their effort to seal off that part of the island with checkpoints — to keep people from disturbing the work in the burn zone — left the area in a ghostly state of isolation. Across the vast green lawns of deserted resorts, it was quiet except for the chittering of sprinklers. The roads were busy, but most stores and restaurants in West Maui were closed. Electricity returned to many places, but cell signal was still spotty, internet even worse. There are warnings about drinking the water, about toxic air.Hawaii residents fear losing Lahaina as fires make housing crisis worseCitizen Church Maui in Kahana has become a main hub to feed those displaced from the fire but also the many others who live along the coast but were far from the flames and have nowhere to eat. Pastor Sarah Beckman’s son, Nick, is the director of logistics for the aid group Mercy Chefs. He flew from Virginia when he learned of the fire and helped establish an operation that is now giving away more than 3,000 meals a day.The food is being cooked by the staff at the Plantation House restaurant at the Kapalua golf course, which is the site of the first PGA golf tournament of the season. Five families, a club employee, two of her tenants, and two Pomeranians are now living in an event space under the restaurant.They have little information to help them make plans for what’s next.“I don’t know who’s missing. I don’t know who’s found,” said Lisa deAquino, who had worked in banquets at the Sheraton Maui Resort and Spa and fled the fire with her husband and two young children. “I’ve been cut off from all social media and news outlets being up here. I have no service.”Whaler’s General Store in Kahana, and its Shell gas station, has been another lifeline for those adrift after the fire. The shelves of the freezer are empty, most of the beer is gone, and the homes of three of its employees burned to the ground, but the store is open.“How are you holding up, Mikey?” a customer asked Michael Nishikuni, who has managed the store for 17 years.“I’m tired,” he said.Nishikuni’s job has been made harder by the government roadblocks that have kept out all but local residents and those who have managed to get their names on the proper lists. Nishikuni lives in Wailuku — outside the government cordon — and some days police let the gas truck pass but won’t let him through. The store doesn’t open without him.“Nobody wanted to take my word for it we have a gas station out here,” he said.He keeps greeting people who don’t know if relatives are alive, and with each passing day he knows it’s more likely they’re not. He doesn’t like the way the shelves of liquor are thinning out.“I hate to see people just drown themselves in that,” he said.At Hanakaoʻo Park, Maui County lifeguards convene by the beach. Firefighters pass through, and there are people living out of cars. Reardon trades information with those who come by his tarp. He has learned that, since the fire, three people he knew may have taken their own lives.“I guess they just figured it was a good time to get off, right?” he said. “The pandemic, you know. And now this.”Reardon owned West Maui Gold and Loan, a pawnshop with a row of surfboards out front. Friedgen worked there and lived upstairs. He’s a musician, too, and when the smoke came pouring into the store he left with just the shorts he was wearing and one guitar.“I just got to where I couldn’t breathe,” Friedgen said. “I was choking. I almost passed out. That would have been it for me, but luckily my friend came along.”Reardon drove them out in his Suzuki, but they didn’t go far, just a few blocks away, afraid that looters might steal things from the shop. When it became clear that the fire would wipe out the store, they evacuated to the police station, then to Kapalua Airport, where they spent the first night in the car.After that, they made their way to the park and have been there since.A couple times, they have returned to the site of the pawnshop, having to sneak past the National Guard at the burn site. They had $2,000 of gold in there. They recovered some.“It was melted,” Friedgen said. “But still gold.”Their spot is under one of Maui’s kiawe trees, a type of mesquite. Known as Canoe Beach, it’s where the Lahaina Canoe Club launches its outriggers into the ocean. The boats remain lined up on the sand.Over the past week, people have stopped by several times to give the two men food and water. The park has bathrooms. But on Tuesday, Friedgen said he’d walked a mile up the coast and could not find any store that was open.Reardon has had a lot of time to think about the island and his place on it. As someone who owned a pawnshop, he was often around homeless people. He never expected the same for himself.In college, he had played strong safety at Washington State University. He has swum in the ocean every day for 25 years, he said, including this week. He’s not worried about contamination.“I think the ocean’s more beautiful now than it was,” he said. “I think the ocean will save this place. I really do.”In the empty hours, he has felt regrets. He should have spent more time with his son, but he was too consumed in his own life. Now his son is a single father himself, and one of Reardon’s favorite things was to walk with his grandson down Front Street, Lahaina’s seaside boulevard. It made him feel as though he got a second chance.He will not make that walk, on that same street, ever again.Matt McClain contributed to this report.An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to the canoe club that launches from Hanakaoʻo Park.

{"id": 9, "Title": "The toxic aftermath of the Maui fires could last for years", "Description": "LAHAINA, Hawaii — This seaside town is a scene of charred devastation. Block after block of blackened wreckage and ash. Many of the homes and apartments, restaurants and bars, surf shops and art galleries that populated this historic Hawaiian community have burned down to their foundations.Hulks of blackened cars are visible throughout the town. Gas stations and propane tanks exploded and boats caught fire in the harbor over the course of hours as the town burned, according to residents who escaped the flames. The raging inferno sent toxic fumes and material spewing throughout the town and into the sea, and whenever the next big storm hits, it will flush even more contamination into local waters.In and around Lahaina, there is still a strong smell of smoldering debris and chemicals in the air. Some of it comes from the abandoned vans and cars, their wheels melted in puddles in the streets, as well as piles of twisted corrugated metal, scores of burned-out washing machines and melted weightlifting sets.Even as the fire retreats, danger remains for Maui residents as they return to the charred wreckage of their neighborhoods. The fire killed more than 100 people as it raged last week. Helping families recover and continuing to identify victims is the immediate priority. But the toxic soot left after an urban conflagration is its own disaster upon a disaster, one that can linger long after the flames themselves have died.“We are going from one natural disaster to the next,” Newsha Ajami, a water expert at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said of the post-fire contamination.When fire consumes a community, it burns indiscriminately through products people need for everyday life — automobiles, home insulation, paint cans, plastics and pressure-treated wood. Those building materials contain lead, arsenic, asbestos and other dangerous chemicals that can go up in smoke and into lungs.“These areas should be approached very carefully, very cautiously,” state toxicologist Diana Felton told residents on Hawaii Public Radio.Debbie Van Alstyne, an employee at the Plantation House Restaurant in Kapalua, said local air quality officials told her and other residents this week that they cannot expect to be back soon in their homes, even if they didn’t burn, because the air is still dangerously contaminated.“You can’t have children playing out there. The air quality coming from Front Street with the winds is deeply toxic with asbestos,” she said. “He says that it’s absolutely not safe for anybody to stay near there. For a while.”Jack Fisher, a musician and real estate broker up the mountain in Kula, watched the “gargantuan” flames Aug. 8 from a distance in his car, running the air conditioner to filter out smoke. He tapped a stash of leftover N95 masks from the days of covid-19 to venture outside the next day.“You could taste it. You could feel it,” he said of the smoke. The fire spared his home but left a sooty mess near an open window. “We lucked out. I thought this place was going up in flames.”After fires, toxic ash and dust that has settled on the ground can be stirred back up into the air months later. And when rain finally falls on the drought-stricken island, it may wash the hazards downstream if not cleaned from the soil in time. Any contamination that goes down the storm drain can end up in the ocean full of surfers and sea turtles.“If it’s not cleaned up properly, it can be released to the environment in different ways,” Ajami said. “Next rainfall, next storm potentially can wash it off to the ocean or actually impact the groundwater, depending on the location. So it’s a big challenge.”Andrew Whelton, an engineering professor at Purdue, said dirt needs to be tested and possibly six inches of soil needs to be removed from contaminated sites. And storm drain interceptors should be deployed to reduce toxic runoff, he said.“People are going back to their properties that may have destroyed structures and encountering hazards that could make them acutely sick if they’re not protected,” Whelton said.Already there is evidence of fouled marine waters. During the first days after the fire, people delivering food and other supplies by jet ski said Lahaina Harbor was nearly entirely covered by a fuel slick left by burned boats. With the harbor now cordoned off, it is difficult to discern how much of the slick remains, but the burned-out and sunken boats will take months to clear.Wildfires can also contaminate people’s drinking water, as overheated plastic pipes leach chemicals into a community’s water delivery system. When such systems lose water pressure — as occurred in Lahaina when the power was knocked out — it can draw even more pollutants into the drinking water.Since Aug. 11, Maui County has been warning residents in certain fire-scarred areas — mainly Lahaina and Upper Kula — about possible water contamination, urging them to avoid the tap for drinking, brushing teeth, making ice and preparing food. Right now, it is unclear what contaminants may be in the drinking water. Officials tested water systems in Lahaina and Upper Kula on Monday, shipping samples to Oahu for analysis.State health officials are also warning those returning to the fire’s footprint to cover themselves head to toe — with N95 masks, goggles, gloves, socks, pants, long-sleeve shirts and closed-toed shoes — to avoid contact with potentially toxic ash. As they clean up their properties, residents are being told to avoid vacuums or leaf blowers that will push ash back into the air.“It just smells like absolute poison. It’s not just like a campfire smell. It’s just in the air. And it feels dirty to breathe,” said one Kula resident cleaning up her neighborhood. She spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect the privacy of her family after the fires.“When you’re up there working in the community and volunteering with your neighbors, there’s just soot in your hair. You’re filthy,” she added.Children in particular need to keep away from rubble, officials warn, in part to avoid lead exposure. Even low levels of lead in blood can impede a child’s performance in school and lead to irreversible brain damage.With many burned neighborhoods still behind police lines, a top pollution priority is getting safe drinking water to people. For now, many residents have resorted to drinking bottled water that is available in pallets at the aid stations in Lahaina and elsewhere along the coast within the security cordon. Earlier this week, residents said small airplanes traversed the coast warning people not to drink the water.Whelton said officials need to go further with their do-not-drink advisory and tell residents to stop bathing with the water, too. He has seen just how contaminated water systems can get after the Marshall Fire in Colorado and the Camp Fire in Paradise, Calif. He was making his way to Hawaii to assess the damage himself Thursday.“I have contacted different agencies and urged them that that alert isn’t protective enough,” he said. “They do not know what’s in the water.”While the situation is bleak now, recovery is possible for wildfire-ravaged towns, Whelton said. “It is possible to have a safe community again and to regain some sense of normalcy.”Grandoni reported from Washington.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/17/maui-fires-pollution-water-soil/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 17, 2023", "Tag": "Ecological", "Keywords": "Keywords: \n\n1.

{"id": 10, "Title": "A rusting tanker, a civil war: Averting environmental disaster in Yemen", "Description": "ABOARD THE FSO SAFER, in the Red Sea — After years of grim warnings that this crippled supertanker, decaying a few miles off the coast of northern Yemen, threatened marine life, global shipping and the health and livelihoods of countless people, a frantic race to empty its perilous cargo — more than a million barrels of oil — was nearly complete.Oil was flowing through hoses on the Safer’s deck to a newer, sturdier tanker moored alongside on a recent afternoon. Crew members took shelter from the punishing sun under tarps on the deck. Delicate operations to stabilize the oil tanks were still underway, but after so many ordeals — the failure of the Safer’s engine and other vital systems, the calamitous predictions that the ship could break apart or even explode — the worst of the danger seemed to have passed.The United Nations, which led the rescue operation, announced late last week that virtually all the oil, amounting to some 42 million gallons, had been transferred off the Safer — an unexpected dose of good news for Yemen, which has suffered through a protracted civil war and a devastating humanitarian crisis.The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people since 2014 and divided the country between rival authorities, making the kind of negotiations the rescue operation required both arduous and exceedingly rare.The Safer contained roughly four times the amount of crude oil that spilled from the Exxon Valdez into Alaska’s Prince William Sound in 1989. The transfer of the crude “prevented what could have been an environmental and humanitarian catastrophe on a colossal scale,” U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said in a statement.For years, efforts to neutralize the threat from the Safer had come up empty — because of the war, disagreements over how the oil should be secured and struggles to raise funding. A renewed effort in 2020 proposed to transfer the oil off the ship to another tanker, rather than securing it in place.The complex initiative required the purchase of an oil tanker, the hiring of a salvage company and coordination between bitter foes on opposite sides of Yemen’s conflict. A Yemeni businessman, Fathi Fahem, played a pivotal role, helping to mediate between the United Nations and the Houthis, the Iranian-backed militant group that rules northern Yemen.“I don’t know what happened between them, but the trust was zero,” Fahem said in an interview.Despite the success of the operation, fears remain that the transfer of the oil could provoke a fresh set of arguments: over who owns the crude, which party should profit from its export and whether the replacement tanker — called the Yemen (formerly the Nautica) — will become a new bargaining chip for the Houthis. A shaky truce has held for more than a year, but the country is still at war, its divisions more entrenched than ever.U.N. officials have downplayed those concerns, focusing on the long odds they overcame since the oil transfer started in late July.“Skepticism was extremely high,” said David Gressly, the U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator for Yemen. “It is at least an indication that an agreement can be reached and carried through.”“It’s good to have a bit of a win in a country that doesn’t see that very often,” he added.The Safer was launched in 1976. About a decade later, it was converted into a floating oil storage and offloading vessel, or FSO, and connected to an oil pipeline in Yemen. Maintenance on the vessel stopped in 2015 after the Houthis deposed Yemen’s government and began consolidating their grip on the north of the country.The rival, internationally recognized government, which is backed by Saudi Arabia, is headquartered in the southern city of Aden.In 2018, the Houthis began raising alarms about the possibility of an explosion or an oil spill from the tanker, even as they initially denied outsiders access to the vessel. Its position in the Red Sea, a few miles from the port city of Hodeida, made it a threat to the import of food and other humanitarian supplies, as well as to fisheries, coral reefs and marine mammals.In the event of a disaster, worst-case scenarios modeled by experts predicted drastic spikes in fuel and food prices; the exposure of millions of people to harmful pollutants; and the loss of hundreds of square miles of agricultural land.In 2020, water leaked into the engine room, which could have resulted “in a catastrophe,” Gressly said. Local crew members and divers were able to secure the leak using rudimentary steel plates, he said.Ibrahim Sharafeddin Al-Mawshiki, a member of a committee that managed the Safer rescue for the Houthi-led government, said the Houthis had consistently cooperated with the United Nations to find a solution to the threat. He blamed the tanker’s decay on a sea and air blockade imposed on Yemen by a Saudi-led military coalition.Fahem worried about the potential ecological damage, but also the threat to his family business, the Fahem Group, which imports wheat and maintains grain silos in the Red Sea port of Al-Salif, near the Safer. He became involved in efforts to save the tanker in 2020, partly out of frustration that earlier initiatives were going nowhere.“We had an interest to protect our future investment,” he said.The only solution was to “replace the old tanker with a new one,” he said. A Dutch salvage company, SMIT Salvage, was identified to prepare the Safer for the oil transfer. “It took a while to convince them to come to Yemen. It wasn’t easy,” Fahem said. The Houthis insisted on Fahem’s personal guarantees, including his assurance that the United Nations would deliver a mooring device, known as a CALM Buoy, to secure the replacement tanker.Fahem was one of the signatories to a memorandum of understanding in March 2022 that committed the United Nations to securing a replacement tanker. “I was put in the middle from the beginning to the end,” he said. “The whole process was really difficult.”The United Nations faced steep challenges as well, including raising $120 million to fund the operation. A replacement tanker had to be purchased, and response equipment positioned should a spill occur, said Mohammed S. Mudawi, the U.N. project manager. There was a time crunch too, given that winds and high waves would pick up beginning in September, making it more difficult to secure the tankers.For the salvage crew, the work was grueling, Mudawi said during an interview in Hodeida.Temperatures on deck could reach more than 120 degrees. “Those on the day shift really struggle,” Mudawi said. At least one member of the Dutch salvage team was forced to go home after a week of work, he said.And the work is not yet done. Crews are still cleaning residual oil from the tanks so the ship can be sold for scrap. U.N. officials hope the tanker parts could fetch about $20 million and contribute to the costs of the rescue operation.But Al-Mawshiki of the Houthi committee cast doubt on the recycling plan, saying in an interview that “what we agreed is that the Safer is going to remain where it is” — a sign of possible disagreements that could surface during the next phase of the operation.Those arguments could extend to who profits from the crude, the majority of which is state-owned, including by an oil company that is now divided between the Houthis and the government in Aden.Fahem said the question of ownership was left to the side on purpose.“We focused on getting the oil as soon as possible to the replacement tanker. And then we have all the time in the world to look at who the oil belongs to.”The oil, he added, “is supposed to belong to Yemen.”Gressly, the U.N. coordinator, said some of the disputes would only be resolved with a peace agreement. But that was a problem for another day.“The oil is not going to collapse into the ocean in six months’ time,” he said. “Let’s hang on to that.”", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/08/17/yemen-war-oil-tanker-rescue/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 17, 2023", "Tag": "Ecological", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 11, "Title": "In Shenandoah, stargazers party as Perseids streak the sky", "Description": "SHENANDOAH NATIONAL PARK, Va. — Under the dark night sky Friday night, a hush fell over the crowd of about 600 visitors spread across the lawn and benches at the Shenandoah Skyland Amphitheater as ranger Dani Goodman launched her slide show talk on the history of stargazing. She spoke about Galileo, the constellations in the prehistoric Lascaux cave paintings in France, and Greek mythological figures for whom the stars are named.Then at about 10 p.m., she flipped off the projector and pulled out a green laser pointer, drawing a resounding “Whoa!” from the audience as she pointed the gadget’s green line of light up at the stars forming the shapes of bears (Ursa Major and Minor), a teapot (Sagittarius), a swan (Cygnus).As the occasional cloud veiled the stars, Goodman harnessed the audience’s energy to clear the sky: “I want this cloud to go away, so everybody blow!”And it must have worked.Just as the visitors craned their necks up to Cygnus flying through the Milky Way, a shooting star streaked the sky, just to the right of her green laser beam … and the crowd simultaneously burst out in awestruck joy: “Ooh!!!”The enormous crowd gathered at the amphitheater were there for a star party on the first night of Shenandoah National Park’s Night Sky Festival. Park officials expect about 2,000 people to come this weekend for the event, which was launched in 2015 and is held annually during the Perseid meteor shower. This year’s festival — the first full-fledged event since 2019 after a pandemic hiatus — coincides with the peak of the Perseids.The Perseids, which streak across the sky at 37 miles per second from mid-July to the end of August, are created by the dusty trail of debris left by Comet Swift-Tuttle, which orbits the sun every 133 years and last came through the solar system in 1992, NASA says.The comet’s debris heats up when met by friction from the Earth’s atmosphere and lights up. The Perseids — named for the constellation Perseus, which is where the meteors appear to come from — are best viewed in the Northern Hemisphere in the hours before dawn, though it may be possible to see them as early as 10 p.m.How to see the Perseid meteor shower this weekend, 2023’s bestThe Night Sky Festival is being celebrated at various locations in the park from Friday to Sunday, free with park admission. Events include talks by a veteran astronaut, NASA and national park experts as well as amateur astronomers on topics ranging from defending Earth from rogue asteroids to America’s largest known impact crater under the Chesapeake Bay.Ranger-led star parties are being held nightly, but the real parties begin after 11 p.m. when the Perseids are most visible. When the Perseids peak Saturday night, dozens to nearly 100 shooting stars per hour will be visible under clear dark skies, according to NASA.After Goodman’s talk Friday night, a line of cars left the amphitheater and drove down Skyline Drive past deer grazing on the roadside to mile 51, where skywatchers headed out to a crunching gravel road in Big Meadows and the sky is visible from horizon to horizon. Couples, families and groups of friends mounted their cameras onto tripods and settled onto blankets and lawn chairs for a night of collective stargazing.There were occasional grumbles as newcomers joined and mistakenly turned on white flashlights — momentarily blinding others, who had to reaccustom their eyes to the dark. But most people enjoyed the dark, relaxing into a happy stargazing bliss while listening to friendly chitchat around them.“This is the first time we’ve come to Big Meadows for the meteor shower. It’s quite exciting,” said Claire Chen, 35, from Potomac, Md., who came with her husband, 5-year-old daughter and friends. “I did see some amazing ones — about five or six, which is pretty cool.”The voices mellowed out after midnight, as sleepy stargazers stuck around at Big Meadows into the wee hours of Saturday morning, in hope of spotting just one more shooting star. The Perseids did not fail them.Some seemed to be brief streaks at the edge of viewers’ peripheral vision. Others were brighter — fireballs created by larger particles that left behind them a green trail in the sky.Marco Heydecker, 33, who is from Germany but lives in Silver Spring, has taken up astrophotography as a hobby and has traveled to dark sky locations around the world.Focused on taking photos, he had missed seeing most of the night’s shooting stars.“I saw two,” he said, laughing. “I hope I recorded them with my camera.”This was his third visit to Shenandoah, and his second time at Big Meadows.“This is a good spot because it’s dark for the East Coast,” he said. “It’s honestly one of the best dark skies close to Washington.”An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to a location as Sky Meadows. It is called Big Meadows.

{"id": 12, "Title": "Hawaii utility faces scrutiny for not cutting power to reduce fire risks", "Description": "KIHEI, Hawaii — Four days before fast-moving brush fires engulfed parts of Maui, weather forecasters warned authorities that powerful wind gusts would trigger dangerous fire conditions across much of the island and Hawaii.The state’s electric utility responded with some preemptive steps but did not use what is widely regarded as the most aggressive but effective safety measure: shutting down the power.Emergency response questioned as Hawaiians survey what remains after wildfiresHawaiian Electric, the utility that oversees Maui Electric and provides service to 95 percent of the state’s residents, did not deploy what’s known as a “public power shutoff plan,” which involves intentionally cutting off electricity to areas where big wind events could spark fires. A number of states, including California, have increasingly adopted this safety strategy after what were then the nation’s most destructive and deadliest modern fires, in 2017 and 2018.Hawaiian Electric was aware that a power shut-off was an effective strategy, documents show, but had not adopted it as part of its fire mitigation plans, according to the company and two former power and energy officials interviewed by The Washington Post. Nor, in the face of predicted dangerous winds, did it act on its own, utility officials said, fearing uncertain consequences.The decision to avoid shutting off power is reflective of the utility’s struggles to bolster its aging and vulnerable infrastructure against wildfires, said Jennifer Potter, who lives in Lahaina and was a member of the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission until just nine months ago.In photos: The scene as deadly wildfires devastate parts of Hawaii“They were not as proactive as they should have been,” Potter said about Hawaiian Electric’s fire-prevention planning, adding that there had not been any real meaningful action to “address some of those inadequacies in terms of wildfire.”Doug McLeod, a former energy commissioner for Maui County, also said the utility was aware of the need for a regular shut-down system and to bury lines, especially given the “number of close calls in the past.”Earlier this week, high winds caused widespread damage to utility infrastructure. The intense gusts knocked down about 30 utility poles across the region, many onto trees and roads, complicating evacuations, according to Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen. He confirmed that some electrical lines were energized when they hit the ground.The cause of the Maui blazes — now the deadliest wildfire in modern U.S. history — remains under investigation. That probe may take weeks or even months to produce official findings, and on Friday, Hawaii Attorney General Anne Lopez (D) announced a “comprehensive review” of the decisions and policies surrounding the fires.On Saturday, LippSmith LLP and other law firms filed a class-action lawsuit against the Hawaii utility, alleging that its downed power lines caused the fire, and that company officials “inexcusably kept their power lines energized” despite fire warnings.Asked about its preparations and response, Hawaiian Electric confirmed that while it does not have a “formal power shutoff\" protocol, it does have a “robust wildfire mitigation and grid resiliency program” that includes managing vegetation, hardening its power systems and inspecting its infrastructure. It also said it took preemptive actions, including “not enabling the automatic reclosure of circuits that may open during a weather event.”The circuit procedure prevents a line from continuing to shower sparks after it has fallen, but does not prevent the initial spark, said Michael Wara, a wildfire expert who directs the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford University. That’s the intent of a “public power shutoff plan,” which does have serious trade-offs.Shutting down power disrupts lives, businesses and can spark backlash, especially if the anticipated wind event does not trigger fires. But as climate change intensifies extreme weather, the move can greatly help a utility prevent destructive and deadly wildfires.Downed power lines, sparks from transmission hubs and other electrical-grid failures have started or helped to spread some of the deadliest and most destructive blazes in U.S. history. That has prompted utilities in states like California, Oregon and Nevada, with approval from regulators, to proactively shut down power to communities when red-flag conditions arise.Hawaiian Electric recognized that a power shut-off plan could be effective, especially after it reviewed what happened with California’s 2018 Camp Fire, which killed 85 people, documents show. In a filing to the state last year, it pointed to California’s Public Power Shutoff Plan as a successful way to prevent wildfires when additional robust techniques are not yet in place.In its statement, however, Hawaiian Electric raised concerns that shutting off power might prevent fire crews from using electricity to draw water they needed for firefighting.A utility spokesperson explained that it is difficult to enact “preemptive, short-notice power shutoffs” because they must be coordinated with first responders and that “notifications also need to be made to customers with special medical needs who use specialized equipment.”Such challenges are a real concern, wildfire experts note, but the purpose of a plan is to organize with agencies in advance. That includes emergency responders who, with enough time, can procure equipment such as backup generators to pump water if the grid goes down.These maps show where wildfires are burning in HawaiiThe vulnerable nature of Hawaii’s grid has also been a concern for years. Old wooden poles are largely uninsulated and strung with lush vegetation over miles of rugged terrain, according to utility specialists. In interviews, residents and energy experts said they have long called for the utility to harden its grid, and despite the cost, to put more of it underground.The poles have been in horrible shape for years, said Potter, the former utilities commissioner. “I think we were all playing on the fact that we got lucky — up until now,” she said.The pattern of Hawaii’s fires suggests that a spate of small ignitions combined to form a bigger blaze, Wara and other experts said. There’d been no lightning strikes, which have sparked series of blazes in other parts of the United States, before the fires broke out. Instead, Wara said, and “the only real source of that is power lines.”The chronology of how and where the fires started, and when and where power equipment had problems, has alarmed many residents and officials.Around 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, a brush fire started near Olinda Road in Kula, a small town in a mountainous region called Upcountry, near Maui’s highest peak. By that point, 80 mph gusts had caused power outages on other parts of the island.Kyle Ellison, who lives in Kula, remembers looking out his bathroom window around 3 a.m. and seeing faint flames coming from Olinda Road. The winds, he recalled “were stronger than anything I’ve ever seen in my life and I’ve lived here 30 years.”A few hours later, shortly after 5 a.m. Hawaiian Electric reported that crews were responding to outages around Lahaina, 30 miles away on the coast. Around 6:30 a.m., another brush fire broke out in Lahaina; officials then said they’d contained that blaze.By 9 a.m., thousands of people in Upcountry lost power “due to high winds,” the utility said on Twitter. “There are several spans of downed power lines in various areas that require repairs,” it wrote. “Mahalo for your patience.” At 9:45 a.m., the utility reported that it was inspecting three main transmission lines to check for damage and also was responding to repair “multiple downed poles and spans of lines in various areas.” Fire officials also warned that these downed lines “may be energized.”Around 11:30 a.m., Ellison and his wife had just finished making chicken nuggets for their children when they heard a crack and a boom, what sounded like a tree going down “and something electrical.” He said his internet shut off and then, shortly after, flames were quickly crawling in the gulch behind his home. Grabbing their children and whatever items they could, the couple sprinted down the driveway and jumped into the car.Photos from Hawaiian Electric on Twitter show wooden poles snapped in half and lines hanging or on the ground. One image was close to Ellison’s home, he said.By late afternoon Tuesday, Ellison and more than 12,400 other people were without power, and about 30 downed poles and “multiple spans of power lines in various areas” across the island were in need of repair, the utility wrote.Then, the Lahaina Fire flared up again. Shortly after, flames seized the town, consuming the popular tourist destination Front Street and jumping from building to building, forcing some residents to flee into the ocean.The horrific scenes, stories of survival and shocking loss of life feel traumatically familiar to the moment that arguably changed how the nation thinks about wildfires and their potentially catastrophic impacts: The 2017 Tubbs Fire, when flames rushed over parched hillsides and jumped a freeway into the Northern California city of Santa Rosa in what felt like a matter of minutes, incinerating apartment complexes, out of which people narrowly escaped, and killing 22 people.How the Maui fires compare with some of the deadliest U.S. wildfiresThe country would see this happen again, with the deadliest wildfire hitting California just a year later. On a bone-dry, gusty day in November, the Camp Fire nearly incinerated the rural town of Paradise, again catching hundreds of residents by surprise and killing 85 people.Ultimately it was a utility company, Pacific Gas & Electric, that was blamed for the Camp Fire, as well as several other major blazes, ignoring warnings from state officials about its aged equipment, inspections and other protocols. In 2020, PG&E, which has since filed for bankruptcy, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter.Like California and other western states, Hawaii is becoming more prone to wildfires, in part because of climate change but also because of other human-linked phenomena — such the spread of nonnative grasses, which become fuel for fires when they dry out.In filings with the state, Hawaiian Electric has been detailing its goals to make its infrastructure more resilient. These include putting lines underground in vulnerable areas, hardening poles and launching a program to remove hazardous trees, according to grid assessment reports and funding applications to the Public Utilities Commission over the past few years.It had closely studied California’s methodologies, including its Power Safety Shutoff (PSPS) Plan. Hawaiian Electric cited it as a strategy that helps mitigate “wildfire risks until more robust preventive measures have been implemented in an area.”The utility also took notice of California’s faults, documents show, having considered the state’s “devastating wildfires of 2018,” as well as its own experiences in 2019. It noted that utility companies can be held liable when it comes to sparking or spreading a wildfire, and cited PG&E’s $15 billion settlement with victims as an example.“The risk of a utility system causing a wildfire ignition is significant,” the company wrote last summer. As a result, it wanted to take the adequate steps to ensure that its facilities would not be “the origin or contributing source of ignition for a wildfire.”", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/12/maui-fire-electric-utility/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 12, 2023", "Tag": "Ecological", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 13, "Title": "See the historic sites of Lahaina before and after the Maui wildfires", "Description": "Plantation-era wooden buildings turned to ashes. Landmarks made from coral, lava rock and concrete hollowed out by flames. A once-quaint historic street blackened and wrecked.The wildfire that ravaged Maui this week, killing at least 80, decimated homes and incinerated cultural sites in the historic town of Lahaina. As rescue crews continue working and more than 14,000 people face displacement, the focus there is on helping those who lost their homes, treating the injured and locating the hundreds still missing.Hawaii utility under scrutiny for not cutting power to reduce fire risksAdding to the devastation is the loss of some of Lahaina’s culturally rich places, spots that visitors to Maui remember and locals had painstakingly preserved. Over the last 200 years, most of them have been damaged or destroyed – by the strong Kauaula wind, by accidental fires, by time – and rebuilt.That could happen again, meaning the precious sites may not be lost forever.“I know we’re going to rebuild, and I know the entire town is going to come together,” said Kimberly Flook, deputy executive director of the Lahaina Restoration Foundation.“The physical manifestation of the many stories of Lahiana have been lost, but the stories themselves are not,” she said. “The stories have not gone anywhere. The culture lives in the community.”What we know about the cause of the Maui wildfiresThe town is rich in royal Hawaiian history and home to remnants of the missionary era — a place sometimes called Maui’s crown jewel or the colonial Williamsburg of the Pacific. Taking stock of the wreckage there was only just beginning. Flook’s organization was making assumptions about buildings’ fates based on videos and photos, satellite images and the path of the fire.Ticking through a list of the town’s historic sites meant ticking through a list of places that were likely mostly destroyed, from a Chinese hall that once served as a social center for immigrants to an erstwhile jail that rounded up rowdy sailors for infractions like drunkenness and adultery.Maui fires not just due to climate change but a ‘compound disaster’Wooden structures – the Wo Hing Museum and Cookhouse, the cell blocks and gatehouse at the Old Lahaina Prison – are presumed to be gone. The Waiola Church, which recently celebrated its 200th anniversary, was engulfed in flames. The Lahaina Harbor was charred and blackened, wreckage floating in the water.Lahaina historic districts mapStone and concrete buildings – the Baldwin Home, the oldest house on Maui; the Old Lahaina Courthouse, which housed a heritage museum; the Masters Reading Room, an 1800s club for ship captains – may have their walls left. Made of coral, lava rock and concrete, such historical buildings often had wooden floors, roofs and other parts, Flook said. She saw a video of Baldwin Home on fire and satellite images showed the courthouse’s coral block walls left standing.After five hours in ocean, Maui fire survivor is ‘blessed to be alive’The restaurant Fleetwood’s – which stood on the merchant site that served as the town’s “center of life” in the Plantation Era, Flook said – was reduced to charred walls and rubble.The destruction is “pretty devastating,” said Nicholas Rajkovich, a University of Buffalo architecture professor who briefly lived on Maui in the mid-2000s.Powered by hurricane-force winds, the wildfires on Maui nearly impossible to prepare for or combat. In Hawaii, hurricanes and floods pose more common threats.“We certainly knew that if a fire started, we were ripe for an issue, but natural fires weren’t a major concern,” Flook said. “In terms of climate change, we were way more focused on sea rise and king tides and tsunamis.”In photos: The scene as deadly wildfires devastate parts of HawaiiSometimes, buildings can be moved or raised in efforts to guard against extreme weather. But that often doesn’t work for buildings of cultural significance, which are tied to a specific location and derive their meaning from their context, Rajkovich said.And on the whole, little can be done to protect buildings caught in the path of such a catastrophic blaze, especially wooden ones, experts said.“Based on the images I’ve seen, it seems pretty hard to imagine what could possibly protect a building in this context,” said Daniel Barber, head of the University of Technology Sydney’s architecture department.The cultural loss is steep. Lahaina holds architectural and historic significance, and its buildings speak to the town’s Hawaiian origins, said Bill Chapman, head of the graduate program in historic preservation at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa.He is working with colleagues on a book about architectural conservation that was supposed to dive into Lahaina’s history. Now, it will require a caveat.“We’re going to have to have a dark box in there,” he said, “to explain that Lahaina isn’t what it was.”Most of the town’s landmarks had been painstakingly restored at least once over the decades. The Waiola Church, which had celebrated its 200th anniversary in May, had been destroyed by weather or accidental fires and rebuilt four times before: in 1858, 1894, 1947 and 1951.And in 1919, a fire broke out that destroyed part of Lahaina. What was built in its place, Flook said, became “part of the flavor of the town,” an area people loved.“We’ve rebuilt fallen structures from the ground up before, so it’s not impossible to redo it,” said Flook.When they can return to town, the Lahaina Restoration Foundation staff will begin surveying the damage, starting on insurance claims and FEMA paperwork. Buildings with some stable bones left could possibly be restored; the wooden ones would have to be fully recreated, Flook said.Eventually, preservationists will likely solicit donations and start making plans to rebuild.For now, the focus remains on humanitarian aid.Wong, the chef who worked at the nearly 120-year-old Pioneer Inn, described community efforts to help displaced people and coordinate donations of supplies. She was working with a group to make lunches for 2,000 people and dinners for another 2,000.“The priority is life, is our neighbors and our friends and our family. … I can always build another restaurant,” Wong said. “We need to find safety and shelter and food and water. That is all anybody is thinking about.”Natalie B.

{"id": 14, "Title": "Cascading environmental impacts feared from ‘wasteland’ of Maui fires", "Description": "In the wake of the devastating Hawaii wildfires, experts fear a broader environmental catastrophe is only just starting to unfold.The fires have torn through vegetation and probably left toxic chemicals in their wake that could easily be flushed into creeks and the ocean. The extent of the damage won’t be known for some time, but experts worry about impacts on native plants and animals that aren’t adapted to thrive with fire. That flora and fauna will struggle to survive in charred landscapes and polluted waters.“When a fire like this comes through, and everything is destroyed, it hurts your soul,” said Kimberly Thayer, a program associate at Mauna Kahalawai Watershed Partnership.For now, the focus of conservation groups in Maui is on those who have been hurt by the fires. There have been at least  67  deaths reported,  and the toll is expected to rise. The fires also burned homes and left the historic town of Lahaina in ruins.“We have staff, family, friends and colleagues that are facing unimaginable loss,” said Heather Starck, the executive director of the Coral Reef Alliance. “The people are the most important right now to everyone.”Still, the time will come when those working on the ground will turn their attention to native plants and wildlife, which carry cultural significance to Indigenous Hawaiians, support the local economy and contribute to driving tourism to the islands.Of primary concern are the corals off the state’s shores. The reefs next to any land that burned are at risk — roughly 2,000 acres burned in six fires, Hawaii Emergency Management Agency officials said Thursday afternoon — but experts are particularly worried about the reefs near Lahaina, such as the Olowalu Reef, which is home to some of the oldest reef structures in the Hawaiian islands.Runoff and debris from the land are the main threats, though ash raining into the ocean could also block sunlight necessary for photosynthesis from reaching the reefs.Jennifer Smith, a coral reef expert at the University of California at San Diego, described the fires as having created a “massive wasteland” of chemicals and other toxic substances that could be washed into the oceans during a downpour. Fires also destroy vegetation, accelerating runoff, she said.“Think about people’s garages and what they were storing in there,” she said. “That’s all been turned to ash.”Smith said the sediments, ash and debris could effectively bury the reefs if they were to enter the oceans in large quantities. If the runoff were to carry fertilizers or sewage rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, Smith said the reefs could also run the risk of an algae bloom, which can overgrow and smother corals.The fires come at a time when Hawaii’s coral reefs are already stressed. During 2014 and 2015, unprecedented portions of the reefs were bleached, with up to half of some reefs killed by the higher El Niño water temperatures. The reefs also face myriad threats such as increased coastal development, pollution and overfishing.Manuel Mejia, the Hawaii program director for the Coral Reef Alliance, said experts were already bracing for a bleaching event later this year if the oceans continue to warm. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared the arrival of an El Niño in June.“Corals are resilient, but it may be too much, all at once,” he said. He said having such a severe fire next to a coral reef area in Hawaii is unprecedented.The fires could also pose a threat to the native vegetation on land, though experts said that in some regards, the factors that have made the wildfires so devastating will also blunt their impacts to native flora and fauna.The fires were exacerbated by a dried-out landscape and the spread of flammable invasive grasses across abandoned farm fields. Smith said the absence of the same rains that proved so elusive in alleviating dry conditions could help prevent runoff from the oceans into the water. And Thayer said much of the burn scar already lost native species, leaving behind fewer to be further devastated by the fires.Still, there will be consequences. The islands already suffer from nonnative plants and animals that have wreaked havoc on species that evolved to live on islands with little competition. Wildfires in Hawaii directly kill plants and animals, and they also accelerate the spread of nonnative grasses that bounce back more easily after a blaze, crowding out the regrowth of native species and creating more fuel for the next fire.Thayer cited bees as a species that could be hurt. Native Hawaiian plants such as the bright yellow ilima flower attract these pollinators, and they are still “scattered around,” Thayer said. Fires can further diminish the presence of these flowers, in turn precluding the native bee species from pollinating these plants.Thayer said the soil seed bank — the natural storage of seeds within the soil — is also threatened by high temperatures. Unlike in the western United States, where moderate blazes can help some species release seeds from their cones, fire in Hawaii doesn’t help seeds germinate or spread, let alone grow, Thayer said. She said with each passing fire, the likelihood decreases of there being a viable seed bank remaining in the soil.She recalled a fire that tore through a native forest habitat in Maui at the end of last year. While the impacts of the fire are still not fully known, and damage assessments from researchers are ongoing, she said, there are signs of hope: Native ferns are growing new fronds, and some of the burned trees and shrubs are putting out shoots. But Thayer said it will take time to understand whether these fledgling plants can outcompete the nonnative species.“When the fire went up the mountain, tears were shed,” she said. “Now this, with lives lost?” She trailed off, then spoke. “It’s really bad. It’s a crazy thing.”", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/11/maui-fires-environmental-impact/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 11, 2023", "Tag": "Ecological", "Keywords": "Keywords: Hawaii wildfires, environmental catastrophe, native plants, wildlife, coral reefs, toxins, runoff, debris, ash."}
{"id": 15, "Title": "2023 is on track to be the hottest year on record", "Description": "This year is increasingly likely to become the hottest year on record, due to a rapidly strengthening El Niño weather pattern and unprecedentedly hot summer.According to climate scientist Zeke Hausfather, 2023 now has an 85 percent chance of becoming the hottest year in the books based on calculations with temperature data from the European Commission’s Copernicus Climate Change Service.Analyses with other temperature data — from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA, among others — have also shown more than a 50 percent chance that 2023 will be the warmest on record. At the end of June, the nonprofit Berkeley Earth forecast an 81 percent chance of a record 2023.“I think it is very safe to say at this point that 2023 is the odds-on favorite to be the warmest year on record,” said Hausfather, who had thought 2023 would land as the fifth hottest at the beginning of this year. “What’s changed is the last two months have been incredibly hot, setting records by a very large margin compared to what we’ve seen in the past.”July was confirmed as the warmest on record of any month, the Copernicus Climate Change Service reported on Tuesday. It was estimated at around 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) warmer than the preindustrial average and shattered the previous July 2019 record by a whopping 0.59 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius).The world also just went through the hottest June on record, according to data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.“In each case the source of the data and the processing is different, but all will be reasonable reflections of what is actually happening. It’s hot,” Gavin Schmidt, Director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, tweeted.The rankings shouldn’t be surprising for anyone who has been living on Earth over the past two months. Phoenix hit daily highs of 110 degrees Fahrenheit for 31 consecutive days. The heat index in the Middle East reached 152 degrees Fahrenheit (66.7 degrees Celsius), near the upper limits for what the human body can tolerate. China reached an all-time high of 126 degrees Fahrenheit. The Southern United States has experienced a historically intense and long heat wave, extending from California to Florida. Warm temperatures have also pushed Antarctic sea ice to all-time lows.Many of the annual temperature forecasts, Hausfather explained, take into account temperatures so far this year, the predicted El Niño state for the rest of the year and last year’s temperatures to understand the baseline that 2023 will be building on.The beginning of the year started out cold, and models showed uncertainty in the developing El Niño event. As the year progressed, the forecasts became refined with more data, including warmer monthly temperatures and updated El Niño models. Some forecasts weigh these elements differently, which produces different forecasts, but all are increasingly pointing to an unprecedented 2023.Hausfather said summer temperatures have rapidly increased as a burgeoning El Niño pattern strengthens. An El Niño pattern is marked by an increase in ocean temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean, which heat the atmosphere. The year 2016, tied for the warmest year on record, experienced a strong El Niño event early in the year.Models indicate that this year’s El Niño is expected to be one of the strongest events in recent decades, but Hausfather said it probably won’t be as strong as the one in 2016. But at the same time, he said this year’s event is unusual because it quickly followed three years of La Niña conditions, its counterpart that tends to bring relatively cooler temperatures.“The La Niña was suppressing the warming we’d otherwise experience in greenhouse gases globally, and now this is enhancing it,” said Hausfather, the climate lead at the payments company Stripe. “Flipping from one to the other, it leads to these fairly large jumps in temperature.”Human-caused climate is the other major player, sending exceptional amounts of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases into our atmosphere. If warming continues at the current rate, average surface temperatures could exceed and remain above 1.5 degrees Celsius in the mid-2030s, which scientists say would result in a range of new climate disasters. The World Meteorological Organization predicted that the annual temperature could even temporarily reach above 1.5 degrees Celsius for at least one year in the next four years.Scientists may not know how many degrees warmer this year will end, but Hausfather said he expects “much of the rest of the year to be in record territory.” Even if temperatures were to go down for the rest of the year, he said we’re still more likely than not going to see a record.And that’s just 2023. Some scientists, including Hausfather, think 2023 may just be a preamble to an even hotter year, when El Niño conditions are in full force.“There’s a lot of reason to suspect that the El Niño conditions that are currently growing are more likely to impact 2024 temperatures overall than this year,” he said.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/08/2023-is-track-be-hottest-year-record/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 8, 2023", "Tag": "Ecological", "Keywords": "El Niño, hottest year, record temperature."}

{"id": 17, "Title": "Biden expected to create Grand Canyon national monument to block new mining, sources say", "Description": "President Biden is leaning toward designating a vast area near the Grand Canyon as a national monument to safeguard it from uranium mining, according to five people familiar with the plans.Leaders of local tribes and environmentalists have spent years lobbying to protect areas near the park from potential uranium mining, which they say would threaten aquifers and water supplies. They have asked Washington to double the protected area around the canyon by including 1.1 million acres of public lands in a Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument.Biden is doing a tour through Arizona next week. The White House previously announced that the president would make climate change and his environmental agenda a focus of his stops on the tour.Federal officials have started telling tribal and environmental groups to be available for a potential Grand Canyon announcement early next week, which would fall during Biden’s travel, said four of the people, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an announcement not yet public.“No decisions have been made,” White House spokesman Abdullah Hasan said in an email. “But I can tell you that President Biden has conserved more land and water in his first year than any president since JFK, and his climate protection record is unmatched.”Advocates have been lobbying for a monument designation in part to honor long-standing Native American connections to the Grand Canyon. For the Havasupai Tribe, Baaj Nwaavjo means “where tribes roam,” and for the Hopi Tribe, I’tah Kukveni means “our ancestral footprints.” Other tribes, including the Hualapai, which means “people of the tall pines,” also have advocated the designation.“This monument will show that we are beginning to protect the lands of the world,” Dianna Sue WhiteDove Uqualla, a Havasupai Tribal Council member, said in a July statement anticipating the decision and provided by a coalition of monument advocates.They have proposed that the new monument consist of three big sections, two of them on the park’s northern border and the third to its southeast, according to maps provided by advocates. The maps show that most of the uranium claims, including six existing mines, would be in the biggest section northwest of the park, part of a remote area called the Arizona Strip known for ponderosa pine forests, grassy meadows and few tourists.Federal officials have not yet made clear the borders they will set for the designation, the people said. But two said Biden officials in recent weeks have signaled support for the proposal. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland visited the land near the Grand Canyon in May, the type of visit that often is a precursor to a presidential proclamation.Uranium mining interests have voiced opposition to the proposal, as have some ranchers in southern Utah who graze their cattle in the winter on public lands that are part of the proposed new monument area.Proposed protections for Grand Canyon spark fight over uranium miningIndustry officials said they will explore ways to fight the decision. They said it would lock up some of the country’s highest-grade uranium deposits at a time when such fuel would be useful to the country’s clean energy and geopolitical goals. Russia provides more than 20 percent of U.S. nuclear fuel, and Congress is actively exploring new laws to boost U.S. uranium production and enrichment in response to Moscow’s war on Ukraine.In an email, Curtis Moore, senior vice president of marketing and corporate development for Energy Fuels — one of the few uranium miners with operations in the United States — blasted the decision as making “zero sense.”He said it contradicts several of the administration’s stated policies, including “supporting clean energy production and punishing Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.”Monument advocates have said only 1.3 percent of U.S. uranium reserves are in the Grand Canyon region.Biden administration officials have said they are trying to prioritize new domestic mining for the materials to support clean energy development. But so far, Biden has made much more progress toward his conservation goals.That includes several announcements just this year — often in partnership with Native Americans — to advance his pledge to protect 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. The president has said he is committed to protecting wildlife and limiting the sources of planet-warming emissions in proclamations this year to protect a former military training and testing site in El Paso called Castner Range, the area around the Avi Kwa Ame (ah-VEE-kwah-may) sacred tribal site in southern Nevada, and U.S. waters in the Arctic Ocean.The announcement would help kick off an effort to promote Biden’s climate agenda, including progress from last year’s major climate-spending law, the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden is planning a three-state tour, with other stops in New Mexico and Utah, to talk about billions of dollars of investment that the law has prompted manufacturing companies to commit to making equipment that produces cleaner energy.Arizona has become a major focus for Biden and other Democrats as they have gained ground politically in the state. The state has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of their big spending bills, with more than $8 billion in planned investment in a giant battery factory and other manufacturing developments, especially near Phoenix, according to the advocacy group Climate Power, which tracks such announcements.The state also has experienced several emergencies related to climate change this year. It set heat records with temperatures above 110 degrees throughout July and has fought several neighboring states over water rights for supplies available from the shrinking Colorado River during an extreme drought across the region.Although tribes and conservation advocates have long been concerned about mining near the Grand Canyon, the ongoing water crisis had led them to put more emphasis on several streams in the proposed monument that could be vulnerable.Environmental groups point to a Colorado College poll from this year that showed vast support among Arizonans for action on conservation and water protections. That includes 62 percent support for legislation to permanently ban new mining on public lands surrounding the canyon.In 2012, the Obama administration blocked new mining on federal land in the area for 20 years. The Trump administration then unsuccessfully proposed reopening the land to new uranium mining in 2020. The 20-year ban expires in January 2032, leading advocates to call for permanent protections.A coalition of several tribes, including the local Havasupai and Hopi, have advocated for Biden to make a national monument designation under the 1906 Antiquities Act. Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.) and Arizona’s two senators — Mark Kelly, a Democrat, and Kyrsten Sinema, an independent — have pushed legislation to make the moratorium permanent but have faced opposition in the Republican-controlled House.Joshua Partlow and Yvonne Wingett Sanchez contributed to this report.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/04/arizona-national-monument-uranium-mining/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 4, 2023", "Tag": "Ecological", "Keywords": "Keywords: Biden, Grand Canyon, Monument."}
{"id": 18, "Title": "The U.N. warns ‘an era of global boiling’ has started. What does that mean?", "Description": "The U.N. chief issued a stark warning on climate change this week: “The era of global warming has ended; the era of global boiling has arrived,” António Guterres declared in a news briefing, as scientists confirmed that July is set to become Earth’s hottest month on record.“Climate change is here. It is terrifying. And it is just the beginning,” he said at a briefing at U.N. headquarters in New York on Thursday, as he described “children swept away by monsoon rains, families running from the flames [and] workers collapsing in scorching heat.”He added that data showed that “July has already seen the hottest three-week period ever recorded; the three hottest days on record; and the highest-ever ocean temperatures for this time of year.”His speech has sparked a surge of interest in the term “global boiling” and what it means — although scientists are divided on its use, with some pointing out that it is not a scientific term, even as others say it could be relevant.“He [Guterres] tried to come up with an even more compelling and sensational wording to try and get people’s attention, and I think we all understand why he’s doing that, because we have to make the governments take climate change seriously and put it at the top of their agendas,” Piers Forster, professor of climate physics at the University of Leeds in England and chair of Britain’s Climate Change Committee, said in an interview Saturday.“But I think some of what he’s saying now is beginning to depart from the underlying scientific evidence, and ultimately that begins to lose credibility over time. It just desensitizes us all.”The changes are “extreme, but these are exactly in line with our predictions,” Forster said. “This is what we told people would occur 20 years ago, and it’s occurring.”This isn’t the first time the United Nations has coined a term in an attempt to convey to the public the risk posed by climate change.  In 2021, Guterres used the phrase “code red for humanity” to describe the findings of a landmark report that said humans had pushed the climate into “unprecedented territory.”Humans have pushed the climate into ‘unprecedented’ territory, landmark U.N. report findsSonia I. Seneviratne, professor of land-climate dynamics at ETH Zurich in Switzerland, said she believes that some previous terms — including the “code red for humanity” — were useful in underlining the importance of the issue.“But I guess at some point we run out of basically superlatives to convey how urgent it is to act. And then the main issue is maybe not so much wording, but just a realization that we are in the current climate crisis. ”“From my perspective, and I think many of my colleagues, I would definitely say that there is a feeling that the emergency, how urgent the situation is, is maybe not really perceived by the general public, or not sufficiently.”Suraje Dessai, a professor of climate change adaptation at Leeds University, said that “we probably need a diversity of ways of trying to communicate climate change to the public so that they can understand the urgency of this.”Global boiling could in fact be “quite relevant” in some circumstances, he said — for example, in places where both temperatures and humidity increase significantly. “That will have a huge impact on mortality, because if both humidity and temperature go up at the same time, then our bodies can’t sweat. Those temperatures happen, for example, across the Middle East and a little bit into Pakistan and India, and in the future that’s going to happen even further.”Some events, including warming oceans and reduction in sea ice, may be happening faster than scientists expected, he continued, “but for example, heat waves, these are things that have been predicted for a long time.”Why a sudden surge of broken heat records is scaring scientistsAll three say that a combination of individual and government action is key.“I think we really need to do a lot,” Dessai said, because countries in Europe and across the world are “not preparing for a changing climate, for heat waves, for sea level rise, for example, for droughts and flooding and so on. We really need to invest to make our societies better prepared for a change in climate.”At the same time, Seneviratne said, the ability of individuals to reduce their emissions can vary from area to area — for example, it may be more difficult to live without a car in parts of the United States than it is in many European countries.How you can lower your carbon footprintIn Switzerland, she said, one estimate calculated that individuals could affect about half of their carbon footprint. “So I would say we need to, you know, to basically act on both sides — there are decisions, there are parts of emissions, which can be reduced by individual decisions, but there’s a large part which needs to be reduced at the global level in terms of changing laws, changing infrastructure.”Forster noted that people feel anxious about climate change but often do not understand what individuals, companies and countries can do.“Part of what we’re witnessing this July is because of climate change, but partly it’s also bad luck,” Forster said. “But we can say with confidence that these are what average conditions will be like in 10 years’ time. So we really have to work really hard to prepare our societies for what’s to come.”Six steps the world can take to halt climate change", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/07/29/un-what-is-global-boiling/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "July 29, 2023", "Tag": "Ecological", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 19, "Title": "As Florida ocean temperatures soar, a race to salvage imperiled corals", "Description": "Inside a low-slung building in the heart of the Florida Keys, Cynthia Lewis is running what she calls a “coral mass triage unit.”As a blistering marine heat wave persists off the coast, a full-blown emergency is unfolding along the only living coral barrier reef in the continental United States.“If it remains this hot for the next six weeks, we are going to see a lot more coral mortality out there,” said Lewis, director of the Florida Institute of Oceanography’s Keys Marine Laboratory.Already, scientists have reported widespread coral bleaching along parts of the roughly 360-mile-long reef, the third largest on the planet. If the heat drags on, they say, a massive coral die-off could follow, with grave consequences for fish and other ocean organisms that depend on the reefs, tourism, commercial fishing and part of the state’s very identity.“This is definitely the worst bleaching event that Florida has ever seen,” said Andrew Baker, who directs the Coral Reef Futures Lab at the University of Miami. “We knew something like this was going to happen at some point, we just didn’t know when. We still managed to be surprised by the magnitude of this event and how early it came in the season.”In a summer that has scorched both land and sea, the precarious future of Florida’s corals offers the latest example of what stands to be irretrievably lost as the world grows ever hotter. Corals can survive high water temperatures, but not for long periods of time, making the arrival of excessive heat so early in the season such a troubling development.Lewis’s lab, with its temperature-controlled, seawater aquariums, is providing refuge to more than 1,500 coral specimens that have been harvested from offshore nurseries and parent colonies, in hopes that they can be returned to the sea when the water finally cools.Day after day, Lewis has seen researchers emerge from their underwater missions shaken by the magnitude of bleaching that they have seen. “It’s emotionally draining,” she said.Figuring out how to help the corals survive the current predicament is difficult and uncertain work. But also critical, Baker said, because this moment is one that could leave a lasting scar up and down Florida’s coastline.“A bleached coral can recover,” he said, “but a dead coral does not.”How early the heat wave arrived is what has proven most unsettling to scientists who study and try to preserve Florida’s imperiled corals.The corals have endured past incidents of bleaching, a process in which stressed corals expel their symbiotic algae, known as zooxanthellae, and turn pale or white. The frequency and severity of such events has increased since the 1980s, and one of the last significant bleaching events off the Florida Keys took place in 2014.That summer, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, high water temperatures in the Keys triggered bleaching that damaged or killed a third of elkhorn coral at seven federal monitoring sites in the Upper Keys.But unlike now, that event spanned August into September, when summer was giving way to fall and waters would naturally begin to cool.“This time, we still have the hottest months of summer ahead of us,” Lewis said. “I’ve seen it before, but not this early.”That’s also partly what worries Derek Manzello, an ecologist and head of NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch program. He said the state has experienced eight coral bleaching events since 1987, but typically they haven’t occurred until at least mid-August. This time, water temperatures began to spike earlier this month.“So we are a full month ahead of when we have historically seen heat stress manifest in Florida,” Manzello said. Meanwhile, he added, “The magnitude of the heat stress is literally off the charts.”Corals comfortably grow in water temperatures between 73 and 84 degrees Fahrenheit, according to NOAA. When water temperatures are too warm, corals push out the algae living in their tissues, triggering a bleaching event. They cannot tolerate high temperatures for long periods.For now, many corals off South Florida are suffering through extraordinary temperatures with no end in sight.On Monday evening, a buoy in Manatee Bay, about 40 miles south of Miami, posted a temperature of 101.1 degrees at 6 p.m. For comparison, the “ideal” temperature of a hot tub is 100 to 102 degrees, according to jacuzzi.com.But that reading was merely one of multiple extreme temperatures in South Florida’s offshore waters. To the southwest, a buoy near Johnson Key topped out at 98.4 degrees. The average of the two dozen observation locations in and around Florida Bay was around 96 degrees during the early evening — even higher than air temperatures.In Key West, ocean temperatures are sitting at 90.5 degrees — well above the monthly average for the area of 87.4 degrees. Water samples off Vaca Key were showing water temperatures at 93.4 degrees as of Tuesday, according to NOAA’s National Data Buoy Center.Underwater, that reality has led to a slow-motion disaster.Ocean temperatures are now so elevated that “it’s likely becoming an existential threat for even the hardiest of corals on Florida’s coral reef,” Phanor Montoya-Maya, a restoration program manager at the Key Largo-based Coral Restoration Foundation, said in an interview.In the Lower Florida Keys, the group said, it has observed “significant coral mortality” at sites including Sombrero Reef, Cheeca Rocks, Horseshoe Reef, Newfound Harbor and Looe Key. It also reported “100 percent bleaching” in the Looe Key Coral Tree Nursery, home to roughly 6,000 corals.“We are seeing extensive coral bleaching and mortality due to these elevated water temperatures,” Montoya-Maya said. “Reefs and nurseries in the Upper Keys are showing early signs of thermal stress, with corals beginning to pale — the first sign of bleaching.”Out of the five levels on NOAA’s alert scale for corals, current conditions are categorized at the most extreme category, known as Alert Level 2. The harrowing conditions are projected to remain for the next 12 weeks, the agency has said.“And the big problem here is, the impacts that a coral experiences are a direct result of how long they are exposed to the stress, and how severe that stress is,” NOAA’s Manzello said.Jesse Senko, a marine conservation biologist and professor at Arizona State University, said that while the El Niño climate pattern that has developed this summer typically fuels hotter ocean temperatures, the current marine heat wave was almost certainly made more severe by climate change.“The worry now is that we’re hitting a tipping point,” Senko said. “Once this becomes the norm and you have multiple summers like this, it could be catastrophic for most of the world’s coral reefs.”In recent decades, healthy coral cover in the Florida Keys has fallen by more than 90 percent due to a range of stressors, including disease, heat stress and damage from boats and storms.That deterioration, along with the prospect of worsening climate change, has led the federal government, universities and nonprofits to ramp up efforts to protect, salvage and restore the reef.It’s also why the ongoing heat wave is particularly disheartening to scientists who have dedicated their lives to studying and preserving Florida’s corals.“It’s upsetting because you realize what is being lost,” said Baker, of the University of Miami.He likened the situation to a forest fire raging through an old growth forest. As heat stress threatens to destroy corals that have blanketed the ocean floor for thousands of years in some places, so much else would disappear along with them.“The reefs provide the ecosystems that support fishing, diving, tourism, jobs,” Lewis said. “In that respect, the reef is very important to the economy of Florida.”The reefs also provide a first line of defense against storms and hurricanes, buffering powerful waves before they arrive on shore.“An underwater sea wall,” is how Baker, whose work focuses in part on helping corals be more resilient to warming water, describes it. “In Florida, we are very flat, and there’s a tremendous amount of built infrastructure. Reefs are really protecting all that.”For all those reasons, Baker said, “Florida is the coral restoration capital of the world. Or it was.”Numerous labs spread throughout the Keys, academic researchers around South Florida and the Tampa Bay region, scientists at the Florida Aquarium and others have spent years working to preserve the corals that remain and undertake creative solutions to help the reef survive in a hotter and more acidic ocean. Government agencies from NOAA to the Defense Department have helped fund such efforts.But amid the current, crippling heat wave, the work of restoration has temporarily taken a back seat to the urgency of trying to protect and salvage what remains.At her lab on Long Key where she has spent more than two decades, Lewis spends these days surrounded by hundreds of threatened coral specimens in her triage unit, where staffers clean the tanks, maintain water temperatures and ensure corals have the food they need.“We are going to save as many corals as we can, so we can maybe build better and stronger corals in the future,” she said, “so that they are more resilient and resistant to the current climate.”She knows that just a few miles away under the water, the situation is dire. But like her colleagues that keep diving beneath the surface, she holds fast to the hope that better days lie ahead.“I refuse to think all is lost.”Ian Livingston contributed to this report.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/07/26/florida-coral-reef-ocean-temperatures-heat/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "July 26, 2023", "Tag": "Ecological", "Keywords": "Keywords: coral mass triage unit, marine heat wave, coral mortality."}
{"id": 20, "Title": "Charles Wurster, scientist who battled to ban pesticide DDT, dies at 92", "Description": "Charles Wurster, a scientist whose battle to ban pesticides helped save the bald eagle and other endangered bird species, and led to the founding of the Environmental Defense Fund, one of America’s premier environmental groups, died July 6 at his daughter’s home in Arlington, Va. He was 92.The cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, said his son, Erik Wurster.Trained in organic chemistry and working as a researcher at Hanover, N.H.-based Dartmouth College, Dr. Wurster began his second career in environmental advocacy in December 1962 with a pen stroke.At a party, he signed a petition calling on town leaders to stop spraying the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, better known as DDT, because a local conservationist alleged it was killing Hanover’s birds. Town officials believed DDT was necessary to eliminate beetles that were plaguing the area’s elm trees.Widely adopted in the 1940s, DDT was generally seen as a miracle product — an insecticide that could wipe out malaria-carrying mosquitoes and other pests, with no obvious harms to humans and animals. It was sprayed around the world, with clouds of DDT misting farmworkers and children sitting at picnic tables, and won its inventor, Swiss chemist Paul Müller, a Nobel Prize in 1948.When town officials shrugged off the petition, Dr. Wurster, his then-wife, and two other Dartmouth colleagues decided to study the spray’s effects.They counted birds found at sites slated to be sprayed in Hanover in April 1963, then did the same for a control population more than a mile away — and watched what happened as the town’s planned three-day DDT spray went forward.The study captivated Dartmouth colleagues and students, who raced to tell Dr. Wurster about robins that they saw spasming in pain in the days after the DDT spray or brought the twitching birds to his laboratory.Within several weeks, Dr. Wurster’s laboratory freezer was jammed with 151 dead birds from Hanover — and only 10 dead birds from the control group across the river. Through their analysis, the researchers concluded that after days of feeding on contaminated insects, the birds accumulated lethal concentrations of DDT in their brains. They published their findings in Science magazine two years later.Meanwhile, Hanover’s elm trees continued to suffer from a beetle-born disease. Presented with Dr. Wurster’s findings, Hanover officials in 1964 agreed to replace DDT with a less dangerous insecticide, methoxychlor — a muted achievement, Dr. Wurster felt.“We had spent two years stopping DDT in one town, while hundreds of other towns continued to use it, a not especially spectacular performance,” he wrote in his 2015 memoir, “DDT Wars: Rescuing Our National Bird, Preventing Cancer, and Creating the Environmental Defense Fund.”In 1965, Dr. Wurster took a new job as an assistant professor of biological sciences at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and poured his energy into fighting DDT alongside other scientists and conservationists. His anger spilled out in a letter to the editor of the Long Island Press in which he castigated the commissioner of the Suffolk County’s mosquito control board.“It is alarming to think that the dissemination of toxic materials is in the hands of the person who thinks they are harmless,” he wrote in 1966.Dr. Wurster’s letter caught the attention of Victor J. Yannacone Jr., a lawyer who was already suing officials over the dumping of DDT into a nearby lake. Joining forces, Dr. Wurster, Yannacone and allies in the scientific community quickly won an injunction that forced local officials to stop spraying DDT in marshes. They had accomplished in weeks what scientists’ pleas had failed to do for years.The new strategy — a combination of lawsuits and public pressure — proved to be a turning point in the environmental movement, which had received popular support but won few policy changes after Rachel Carson’s landmark 1962 book, “Silent Spring,” elevated awareness of pesticides and other pollutants.DDT also had ample defenders who argued that Dr. Wurster and his colleagues were alarmist. The commissioner of the Suffolk County mosquito control board ate the pesticide in public in an attempt to demonstrate its safety.Dr. Wurster, Yannacone and eight others formed the Environmental Defense Fund in 1967 — the same year the United States declared the bald eagle, America’s national bird, an endangered species.The new group’s legal actions led to a high-profile showdown in Wisconsin, where scientists warned regulators that DDT was imperiling the state’s ecosystem.Dr. Wurster and colleagues testified about the risks to birds of prey such as eagles, ospreys and falcons that fed on DDT-contaminated fish and other organisms. As a result of consuming so much of the pesticide, the environmental experts said, the birds laid thin and brittle eggs that often failed to hatch, imperiling their species’ survival.The hearing stretched for nearly six months. Wisconsin lawmakers and regulators ultimately concluded in 1970 that DDT was a pollutant and should be banned. The EDF later replicated the strategy with regulators in Washington.Dr. Wurster was a “real giant in modern environmentalism,” said Elena Conis, a historian at the University of California at Berkeley who profiled his efforts in “How to Sell a Poison,” her 2022 history of DDT. Conis said that Dr. Wurster laid the groundwork for the modern environmental movement by “putting health at the core” of environmentalists’ work.As the EDF steadily gained attention and acclaim, its leaders broadened their fight to include warnings about the risk of human cancers, citing evidence that DDT caused cancer in test animals. Dr. Wurster — the group’s chief scientist — served as a key spokesperson, dueling with skeptical researchers and taking his case to some of the nation’s highest-profile forums.“A quarter-century ago, man launched a biological experiment of truly colossal proportions, inadvertently using most of the world’s animals as the experimental organisms,” Dr. Wurster wrote in a 1969 op-ed in The Washington Post. “It is time to end the great experiment with DDT.”Dr. Wurster and his allies ultimately won the argument: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1972 banned most uses of DDT in the United States. Bird species threatened by the pesticide made a comeback; the peregrine falcon was removed from the endangered list in 1999, and the bald eagle was removed from the list in 2007.And the EDF’s influence grew, with more than 3 million members and $300 million in annual donations today.“It’s mind boggling to have been there for those first meetings … and see what it has turned into,” Dr. Wurster told the New York Times in 1990.Charles Frederick Wurster Jr., the son of a stockbroker and homemaker, was born in Philadelphia on Aug. 1, 1930, and graduated from nearby Haverford College in 1952. He received a master’s degree from the University of Delaware in 1954 and a doctorate from Stanford University in 1957, both in organic chemistry.He was a Fulbright fellow in Austria in 1957 before taking a job with Monsanto Research Corp. near Boston, where he researched jet fuels and laminating resins before joining Dartmouth in 1962.Dr. Wurster’s marriages to geneticist Doris Sanford and Norwegian diplomat Eva Tank-Nielsen ended in divorce.Survivors include his partner Marie Gladwish of Seattle; a son from his first marriage, Steven Wurster of McCall, Idaho; two children from his second marriage, Nina Wurster of Arlington and Erik Wurster of Brookline, Mass.; and four grandchildren.Dr. Wurster, who retired in 1995 as an assistant professor at SUNY Stony Brook, watched later efforts to revive DDT, including by corporations and libertarian organizations attempting to weaken regulations, and by some public health experts claiming the pesticide would help contain disease outbreaks.“​​DDT was arguably one of the safer insect repellents ever invented — far safer than many of the pesticides that have taken its place,” Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia pediatrician Paul Offit wrote in the Daily Beast in 2017, arguing that DDT’s harms to humans were overstated and its ban led to the reemergence of malaria across the globe.Conis, the historian, noted that while banning DDT was a major achievement that helped save wildlife, “it allowed us … to think that we were getting rid of the worst actor when in fact there were loads and loads of other pesticides” that were equally toxic and remained on the market.Dr. Wurster grew frustrated by regulatory rollbacks under the Trump administration and what he saw as the discrediting of environmental scientists, and he suggested that the EDF reframe its agenda by focusing on the harms of air pollution.“The term ‘climate change’ has become so political that many people simply tune out that topic,” he wrote to EDF leaders in 2017. “Deaths and human health are not as easily dismissed.”", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/07/25/charles-wurster-environmental-defense-fund-dead/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "July 25, 2023", "Tag": "Ecological", "Keywords": "Keywords: \n\n1.

{"id": 21, "Title": "Sesame oil belongs in your pantry. Here’s how to use it.", "Description": "Sesame seeds are about 50 percent oil by weight, and the oil extracted from them is one of the oldest foods made by humans. Sesame oil is most often prized for the wonderfully nutty flavor and aroma it adds to dishes, particularly in many Asian and Middle Eastern cuisines, where it’s a staple ingredient and integral to those regions’ flavor profiles. (It is also known as gingelly oil in South Indian cooking.)“It’s just so necessary for everything,” chef and cookbook author Jon Kung said.Sesame oil comes in a range of hues, potencies and uses. Here’s what you need to know about the different varieties to make the most of them.The refined version of sesame oil creates a very light colored, neutral tasting oil that is good for all-purpose cooking. It has a smoke point of somewhere between 410 and 445 degrees and can be used similarly to other neutral oils, such as canola or vegetable oil. Since there’s not much difference between refined sesame oil and other neutral oils, there’s no reason to add it to your pantry if it’s not already there.1/3Unrefined sesame oil is a different story. “It just adds an aromatic punch to things,” Kung said. It can be found untoasted and toasted, with the latter being more common. “Even at, like, really well-stocked grocery stores, I see variations of toasted sesame oil, but I don’t see the other stuff very much,” Kung said.Whether toasted or untoasted, unrefined sesame oils add a delicious nuttiness to whatever they touch, but the toasted variety — made from seeds that are toasted or roasted before being processed for oil — packs a much more potent punch.In her recipe for Sheet Pan Kimchi Noodles, cookbook author and our Plant Powered II newsletter writer Hetty Lui McKinnon specifies untoasted sesame oil for drizzling over the finished dish. “Normally I’d use toasted sesame oil for topping dishes but because toasted sesame oil and kimchi are both very flavorful, I didn’t want to overpower the kimchi with the sesame flavor,” McKinnon said. Untoasted “adds a gentle essence without a huge punch. In this case, it feels more balanced.”But if you’re just looking to add one new bottle to your pantry, toasted is the way to go. “I love its big flavor, so most of the time I will use toasted,” McKinnon said. And if you ever come across a recipe that specifies untoasted when toasted is all you have, you can simply use less to achieve the intended flavor profile.Toasted sesame oil is typically used as a finishing oil and in dressings and sauces — one of my most common uses is in a dip for dumplings alongside soy sauce and vinegar. Kung’s favorite thing to add it to is rice for a boost of flavor and because it “separates the rice a little bit for a nicer mouthfeel,” he said. The oil is also often mixed with ground meat for dumplings or wontons. Beyond these uses, you can drizzle it over soups, vegetables, roasted or grilled meats, or just about anything else you can think of to instantly add depth and complexity.The untoasted oil can also be used to cook with over low or medium heat. “I will most often add some untoasted sesame oil to neutral oil for stir frying, to give the dish more foundational flavor,” McKinnon said. “Heat will bring out more flavors in the sesame oil and will inject your dish with a nutty perfume.”Toasted sesame oil is known for its resistance to oxidation and rancidity, but it does not last forever. “Eventually, the oil will become rancid: it will turn darker in color, develop a harsh aroma like paint thinner or nail polish remover, and start to taste unpleasant,” food writer Max Falkowitz wrote for online retailer Snuk Foods. He recommends using the oil within six months when stored in a cool dark place, or you can preserve the quality even longer by storing it in the refrigerator. But I’m pretty sure the bottle in my pantry has been there much longer, so just give yours a whiff to make sure it’s still good before using.With toasted sesame oil, a little bit goes a long way. So buy it in smaller quantities unless you know that you’ll go through it quickly.And if you’re looking to put the bottle in your kitchen to better use, here are a few recipes from our archives that feature sesame oil: Spicy Sesame Chile Oil Noodles, Sesame Vinaigrette, Korean Rice Cakes (Tteok) With Spicy Sausage and Kimchi, Sesame-Chili Salsa, Creamy Bucatini With Roasted Seaweed, Ssamjang and Sesame Fried Rice With Spring Vegetables and Egg.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2023/08/25/sesame-oil-toasted-untoasted/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 25, 2023", "Tag": "Delicious food", "Keywords": "Sesame oil, Unrefined sesame oil, Toasted sesame oil"}
{"id": 22, "Title": "Salt & Vine draws you in with its looks. But then your food arrives.", "Description": "Salt & Vine has “welcome” splashed all over it.You pull up outside the historic venue, which locals might know as the former Olney House, to find tables spread across the patio and porch of the grand white facade of the building. Step inside, and your appetite is piqued by a wood-burning pizza oven to the left and a tony lounge to your right. A host asks if you have a reservation. Judging by the crowds that flock here, you’re relieved to have a confirmed table. All my visits, I’ve been led upstairs, to one of several dining rooms, each with a different wall treatment. Walking through them is like taking a tour of an interior design showroom.A stranger tipped me off to Salt & Vine, and subsequent online sleuthing suggested the Italian-themed restaurant, opened in May by chef Thomas Zipelli, would be worth my sharing with a larger audience. A 2010 graduate of Johnson & Wales, Zipelli went straight to the celebrated Eleven Madison Park in New York for his internship, after which he was hired and worked his way up to the fish station. When an old roommate told him about an opening at the equally renowned French Laundry, Zipelli left the East Coast for California’s Napa Valley, where he worked his way up to become saucier.1/2From there, the chef took his knives to Canlis in Seattle, another revered dining destination, and later heard from his father: What about opening a place of his own? In 2016, Zipelli returned to Howard County, where the New York native spent his teen years, and took over the Coho Grill in Columbia, which he rebranded as the Turn House. Next, he took over Ricciuti’s in Olney with the intention of simply expanding the bar. But the structure — the former Olney House — was in such bad shape (“about to fall down,” says Zipelli) the chef decided on a top-to-bottom renovation that took more than three years, no thanks to the pandemic. In the meantime, Zipelli added Maggie’s in Westminster, Md., to his collection.Tom Sietsema’s 7 favorite places to eat right nowOn paper, there’s promise at Salt & Vine, where day-to-day cooking falls to chef Eric Frisch, recruited from the Hamilton, part of the Clyde’s Restaurant Group. At first glance, it looks like the kind of restaurant that’s handy for date night, with a group, or when visitors come to town. Thought has gone into the sleek table lights, broad marble tables and comfortable butterscotch-colored leather chairs. I was charmed when I was able to call Salt & Vine to make a reservation after I struck out on Open Table, and a live person found a table for four on a recent Saturday night.Really, what’s not to like?Well, let me tell you about the bread basket I was promised my first meal and never saw, or the calamari so dark they looked as if they were fried in the Phoenix sun — and so small and hard I could have worn them as rings. Their one redeeming quality were the pickled peppers in the mix, which I fetched out and ate as a relish. Half a squeeze bottle of balsamic vinegar appeared to form the thick brown stripes on a clump of radicchio, endive and mozzarella, a sad salad with some oranges tucked into it.The portions are generous, which some diners appreciate. Today’s dinner can be tomorrow’s, too! Unfortunately, a heaping helping of something inferior tends to magnify the dish’s flaws. Mushroom risotto so stiff and dense you could plant a flagpole in it isn’t going to improve on the ninth or tenth bite. Same with the bucatini tossed with sails of pancetta that taste like raw bacon. My most satisfying encounter with pasta here was orecchiette, ear shapes that caught drops of creamy-tasting parmesan sauce and crumbles of fennel pork sausage, sepia tones contrasted with bright broccoli rabe — a common pasta combination done right.Any Day Now shines from morning to nightThis isn’t a complete Titanic, in other words. Navigate around the icebergs on the menu and let “grandma’s” tender meatballs float your boat. The recipe, incorporating beef, veal and pork, pays tribute to the owner’s paternal grandmother, from whom he learned some tricks of the Italian trade on weekend visits to her home outside New York. I also like the oysters, served in their shells with garlic butter, topped with cheese and breadcrumbs that are crisped in a wood-fired oven. And if you’re in the mood for meat, rack of lamb marinated in Dijon mustard, olive oil and herbs trumps the lackluster rib-eye steak. The entrees come with a choice of accompaniments. I side with the crisp smashed potatoes or velvety roasted peppers.Everyone seems happy to see you, but not everyone goes about their duties with the same skill or attention.The best servers know the history of the place, explaining that the pizza oven is the only element to survive the renovation, let you know half-orders of pasta are available and reveal a sense of humor. “Let me tell you about our one-calorie delight,” an attendant said in reference to a plate of housemade truffles. But I’ve also encountered servers who merely fly by after food has been dropped off (“Howseverythinghere?” one said on his way to another table) and staff who show up with dishes that have nowhere to land, since plates haven’t been cleared, forcing diners to scramble to make room for a pizza whose blond bottom appears to have been cooked with nothing hotter than a hair dryer. (Salt & Vine has lots of company when it comes to erratic food delivery. Layer on lesser cooking, though, and customer patience gets stretched.)Drift elevates beach food with stellar seafood and service“My ears are bleeding,” a companion said at the mention of dessert. DID I MENTION SALT & VINE IS LOUD, TOO? The upstairs dining rooms have light from multiple windows in their favor, but little in the way of soundproofing. Given the earlier uneven performances from the kitchen, no one wanted to stick around for another course. But duty calls and we stayed in our seats. Plus, I wanted to see if anyone on staff would free the table of the big shrimp tail, a remnant of an order of seafood stew, left directly in front of me.The truffles, rolled from chocolate infused with raspberry Earl Grey tea, butter and cream, are satisfying. Other confections went unfinished after a sample. A wedge of tiramisu cake was shy on the expected flavors, and the acrid limoncello panna cotta seemed to be sponsored by Pledge. No, grazie.Critics make repeat visits to test places for consistency and sample the range of a menu. I can tell you the drinks and wine list at Salt & Vine are good, beets and goat cheese make a better starter than raw tuna folded over roasted peaches, the fried calamari is always as bronzed as Magda in “There’s Something About Mary,” and the chicken stuffed with cream cheese goes down like chicken Kiev without its breading (and with fat as the prominent flavor). Remove the bland salmon from the cioppino — but keep the plump shrimp — and you’ll have a decent herbed seafood stew. Further, just because something is made on-site doesn’t mark it delicious. Proof: the vapid, snow-white focaccia I eventually received.I can also tell you it gives me zero pleasure seeing so many people working so hard to please their audience with food that doesn’t always hold up its end of the deal.In a story I wrote last year, I explained that while I went to more than 125 restaurants a year, I didn’t bother reviewing all of them. For instance, small or out-of-the-way places that aren’t very good typically go in the Why Bother? category. I felt compelled to write about Salt & Vine because of its history, the owner’s résumé, the pretty packaging and my mission: As much as I like to steer readers to good places to eat, I’d be remiss not to warn them away from middling (or worse) cooking.I eat bad food so you don’t have to.Dessert is typically the last chance a restaurant has to make an impression, one way or the other. In my case, the parting memory at Salt & Vine was the aforementioned shrimp tail — still hanging around on my table, even after I paid my check and rose to go home.3308 Sandy Spring Rd., Olney, Md. 301-570-3388. saltandvine.com.

{"id": 24, "Title": "Parchment-wrapped fish and vegetables dish is pretty (and) delicious", "Description": "I am such a big fan of seafood, some days I look back and realize I ate it for breakfast (smoked salmon on a bagel), lunch (a salad with tuna) and dinner (shrimp or a fish fillet). That reality makes it all the more shocking to me that 80 to 90 percent of people in the United States don’t eat the recommended minimum of two meals of seafood weekly.There are many compelling reasons to do so: The culinary options are boundless, it’s conveniently quick-cooking, and the health benefits are remarkable. Fish provides health-protective omega-3 fats, essential minerals and protein. Plus, there’s the displacement factor — when you eat more seafood, you’re probably eating less meat.Get the recipe: Flounder Nicoise en PapilloteWhether you have been contemplating getting more fish into your meal rotation or you are already a fish lover like I am, this recipe is a sure win. It’s brimming with French Mediterranean flavors, is fast and easy to pull together, but also has a company-worthy elegance to it.It essentially involves piling ingredients onto parchment paper — first a handful of thin green beans, then grape tomatoes, and on top of that, a fillet of flounder or sole. These mild, flaky varieties are ideal for seafood beginners who may be wary of a prominent “fishy” flavor, but any relatively thin fish fillet will work — snapper or trout would be nice, too.Sign up for Voraciously's Plant Powered II newsletter and have more fun cooking with vegetablesOn top of the fish goes a tapenade-like mixture of finely chopped olives seasoned with garlic, thyme, lemon zest and black pepper. (If you have a jar of olive tapenade in your refrigerator, you could certainly use it instead.)After drizzling the pile with oil and lemon juice, you seal up the parchment to form packets. If the idea of folding the parchment feels intimidating, you could place a piece of foil under the parchment at the start and simply crunch it up to close. (While it is probably fine to cook directly in aluminum foil on occasion, I generally avoid doing so to avoid aluminum leaking into the food.)After 12 minutes in the oven, you open the packets and the fragrant steam clears to reveal a flaky fish fillet, crisp-tender green beans and softened tomatoes, all perfectly cooked in lemony juices and punched up with the flavors of olive topping.Serve it directly in the packets or transfer the contents of each to serving plates. Just be sure to include all the mouth-watering juices. I like to serve mine with rice, quinoa or crusty bread to sop them all up.Garnished with lemon wedges and fresh parsley, it’s a dish I bet you’ll want to make again and again, and might even be the one to get you on board with seafood in general.Get the recipe: Flounder Nicoise en Papillote", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2023/08/24/parchment-wrapped-fish-recipe/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 24, 2023", "Tag": "Delicious food", "Keywords": "Fish, Olive Tapenade, Nicoise."}
{"id": 25, "Title": "Peaches and tomatoes take a spicy, crunchy, tangy turn in this chaat", "Description": "At Rasika in downtown Washington, you can order a dish of baby spinach — each leaf lightly battered and quickly fried until crisp — drizzled with yogurt, tamarind and date chutney, sprinkled with minced red onions, tomatoes and cilantro. It is fragrant and pungent, warm and cooling, sweet and sour — all at once. It’s the restaurant’s version of palak chaat, and in addition to being a bestseller, it’s an exemplary rendition of an Indian chaat. “If I ever took it off the menu, I would lose my job,” executive chef Vikram Sunderam says with a chuckle.Chaat comes from a word that in Hindi and Urdu means “to lick” or “to taste.” Accordingly, chaats are a category of snack and street food. Eaten at all times of the day, they are generally served as small plates or large bites. “You can make a chaat out of anything,” says chef and author Maneet Chauhan. Her 2020 book, “Chaat: Recipes from the Kitchens, Markets, and Railways of India,” changed the way I look at snacks and meals.The genre is wonderfully broad and defined more by the flavors and textural characteristics of each dish than specific ingredients, cooking techniques or occasion. Chaats lean vegetarian, but can also be made with fish or meats. They can be entirely savory or mostly sweet, but are often a little of each. Sunderam and Chauhan agree that texture is a key element in any chaat. “There must be some crispiness,” Chauhan says. “You want a balance, so that when you bite into something soft, behind it there is something crunchy,” Sunderam says.Get the recipe: Peach and Tomato Chaat“Growing up in India, one of my favorite things was the seasonality of fruits,” Chauhan says. “When you go to buy fruit from a street vendor, they’ll always ask if you want it plain or made into a chaat. It totally changes your perception of what fruit can be.”If you order your fruit to be made into a chaat, vendors will commonly dress ripe mango, melon or other cut fruit with lime juice and chaat masala, a dry spice blend that adds savory, sour, smoky and spicy-hot notes to each bite. (Chauhan notes that vendors in Mexico do the same thing, using lime juice and Tajín to add acidity, spice and heat to sweet, ripe fruit.) Often, an element of crunch is added in the form of nuts, seeds or crispy chips called sev.These last lazy days of summer have me craving fruit chaats, but I don’t live in India. So I asked the experts for help on how to create a good one.“The ripeness of the fruit is essential in fruit chaats,” Chauhan says. “Then, the other elements just add to it — it’s a party in your mouth. You take a first bite, and it’s announcing itself: ‘Hello! I’m spicy! I’m savory! I’m tart! I’m sweet!’ The flavors should be unexpected, to keep you guessing, to keep you wanting another bite as you put the puzzle of tastes together.”Often, but not always, fruit chaats are finished with a sprinkle of chaat masala. The complex and heady spice mix has no easy substitute. “It’s a little tangy, it has a little heat to it, it’s savory,” Sunderam says. Chefs often make their own blends. Most are based on amchoor, which is dried and finely ground unripe green mango that provides a pungent sourness, and kala namak, which is black salt that adds an umami flavor some describe as a little smoky or sulfurous. Cumin, coriander, fennel seed, ginger, black pepper, chili powder and other spices are common additions. “It’s not necessary for all chaats,” Sunderam says, “but all chaats need some form of pungency.” If that doesn’t come from the spice blend, it must come from a chutney or other element, such as tamarind paste.This Peach and Tomato Chaat is designed with that in mind. Lime juice, fresh ginger, a touch of fresh chile and a bit of sugar or honey form a dressing with chaat masala that helps pull the juices out of the ripe fruit. If you can’t find chaat masala, you can skip it, because the honey, ginger and tamarind paste offer a similar sort of pungency. Whatever you do, don’t skip the crunchy bits. They’ll keep you coming back for more of this firework of flavors.Get the recipe: Peach and Tomato Chaat", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2023/08/24/indian-fruit-chaat-peach-tomato/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 24, 2023", "Tag": "Delicious food", "Keywords": "Palak chaat, Chaat masala, Textured."}

{"id": 29, "Title": "7 easy recipes to whip up in your vacation rental", "Description": "It’s the end of August, and it seems like everyone’s out-of-office messages are on. It’s wonderful to take a break from day-to-day stressors and indulge in little luxuries. Going out to eat every day of vacation can be expensive, though, and if you’re staying in a rental, you might want to take advantage of your place’s kitchen and dining area.Cooking in an unfamiliar kitchen poses its own issues: Nothing is where it should be, the stove runs extra-hot and your favorite pantry staples are missing. Most rental kitchens also have only the (very) bare essentials in terms of equipment and appliances, often looking a bit worse for wear. But a vacation is all about unwinding, not worrying about conjuring up elaborate meals.Cooking at a vacation rental? 6 tips for success.I recommend a couple of things to keep in mind when cooking away from home. Most rentals have the essentials, such as salt, pepper and olive oil, on hand, but if you find yourself without one, it’s worth investing in a small container of whatever is missing — future guests will thank you. Planning ahead is also essential, from packing small kitchen tools, such as actually sharp knives (just make sure to check them if you’re flying!), to making smart, efficient grocery lists. This will help minimize what you have to toss or bring home with you at the end of your stay. Whether you’re staying at a friend’s or renting a place, these recipes will help you navigate your vacation meals seamlessly. Find even more in our recipe archives.Above.

{"id": 31, "Title": "Yes, calories in/calories out really is the key to weight loss", "Description": "All calories are the same, and the only way to lose weight is to burn more of them than you absorb, but nothing good happens if you go out in the world and say that out loud.“LOL!” the responses tend to go. “Calories-in-calories-out has been debunked.” Then there’s the addendum: “this idiot thinks that 1,000 calories of sugar is the same as 1,000 calories of lentils!”Sigh.You know who thinks that? Nobody. Because it’s idiotic.There’s massive confusion about calories-in-calories-out (often abbreviated CICO), but it’s a fundamental weight-loss truth, so I’m going to try to clear it up. (And I hear you saying “Good luck with that.”)The debunking crowd seems to have gotten the idea that a calorie is a unit of food. It isn’t; it’s a unit of energy. The calorie count tells you only one thing about what you eat: the amount of energy that is theoretically available for your body to absorb.Saying all calories are the same is like saying all kilometers, or ounces, or minutes are the same. All minutes are definitely the same! Although you may be feeling that the ones you spend, say, watching baby panda videos are way better than the ones you spend reading this column.Despite being all the same, the calories come in a food package, and there are lots of other things about food that can affect both the calories-in and the calories-out sides of the equation. The real disagreement isn’t over whether this is true; it’s whether the effect is large enough to make a difference in weight loss.So let’s look at how what you’re eating can affect how many of the available calories you absorb and how many you burn.Let’s do absorption first; there are several ways the food matters:Hard-to-digest carbohydrates: While some carbs (think sugar) are easy for our bodies to break down, others (think lentils) are harder. Foods that are high in fiber and other digestion-resistant carbs, like oligosaccharides, and resistant starch don’t get completely broken down. They exit your body, if all goes smoothly, first thing in the morning.Particle size: The bigger the particle size of your food, the less surface area your digestive enzymes have to work with, and the less efficiently you absorb the energy. Almond butter, for example, will net you more calories than whole almonds. Ditto instant oats vs. whole oats. And if you’ve ever eaten corn on the cob, you may have noticed that some of those large particles pass right through you. (This is one of the reasons highly processed foods, which tend to be pulverized, are so insidious.)Your microbiome: Microbes gotta eat! And different foods feed different kinds of microbes. If your microorganisms use the calories, you can’t. We’re just starting to get a handle on how food content fosters, or doesn’t, different microbial communities.All calories are equal? Not to your microbiome.Now let’s look at the burn side:Macronutrient content: Food is made of up of carbohydrates, fat and protein, and your body has to break all of those down to make the calories accessible. That breaking down takes energy (calories!). I think of this as digestive overhead, but scientists call it the “thermic effect of food,” and estimate that it’s about 10 percent of the calories you burn in a day.Each macronutrient is different, though. Fat is easiest for your body to access, and requires under 3 percent of its calories. Carbohydrates are next, at 5 to 10 percent, and protein is highest, at 20 to 30 percent. (People sometimes disagree about the specific numbers, but not the concept or the ballpark.)Metabolism boosting: Some foods may rev you up, at least a little. There’s some evidence that caffeine and capsaicin (the heat in chile peppers), for example, can increase resting metabolism.Hormonal effects: Food can affect the hormones that regulate your metabolism. Low-carb diets, for example, hang their hat on the idea that, if you release less insulin (a hormone integral to fat storage), you cannot store fat, and your body will burn more calories.There are undoubtedly other ways in which what you eat affects how many calories you absorb, many of which we have yet to discover. Of course, there’s also the issue of satiety; if what you eat helps you eat less later, you obviously absorb fewer calories. What all those effects have in common is that someone has tried to sell you a diet based on it.So here’s the burning question: Given all the ways different foods affect calorie absorption and burn, why the focus on calories rather than food?Because all those ways are small. So small that, in trial after trial, no diet, based on any of these things, significantly outperforms any other diet in the long term.And yet, the idea that what you eat is more important than the number of calories you consume has taken hold in the public understanding of weight loss. To figure out why, I checked in with nutrition scientist Marion Nestle. She’s co-author of the book “Why Calories Count,” so you know exactly where she stands.I started off talking about all those ways that what we eat affect how we absorb or burn calories, but she dismissed them wholesale. “It’s trivial!” she said. “In studies where people were locked in metabolic wards, if the calories were lower, they lost weight at a predictable rate, regardless of the composition of the diet.” The diets, she said, “varied from 80 or 90 percent carbs to 80 to 90 percent fat.” And it just didn’t make much difference.This doesn’t mean your food choices are irrelevant. Take highly processed foods, which tend to be calorie-dense, nutrient-challenged, easily eaten and absorbed, and minimally satiating.That’s a combination that can easily lead to overeating, which means, as I’m sure you know by now, more calories.It’s absolutely possible to eat a diet of foods that make it nearly impossible to keep calories in balance. The Häagen-Dazs Diet. The Pepsi Diet. The Bacon Diet. But if you’re looking at reasonable permutations of whole-ish plant and animal foods, the percent of calories you get from protein and the grams of carbs you eat in a day are all but irrelevant for weight loss.If you don’t believe me, or Nestle, I invite you to pop on over to PubMed, the repository of academic papers, and look around. Look at the meta-analyses, which try to make sense of the body of evidence, and find one where a particular kind of diet outperforms others long-term by more than a few pounds.If you find one, send it along.Why, I asked Nestle, are people so resistant to the fact that calories are central to weight loss?“Because you can’t see them,” she said. “And you also can’t count them.” You don’t know exactly how many are in your food, and you don’t know exactly how many of those you absorb, and you don’t know exactly how many you burn. But you can read labels, check calorie counts and venture a guess, and you have an infallible tool to find out if you’re right: “Weigh yourself on a scale,” Nestle said. If you’re not losing weight, you have to find a way to rejigger the equation.It’s the calories, people. It’s the calories.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2023/08/23/calories-in-calories-out-weight-loss/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 23, 2023", "Tag": "Delicious food", "Keywords": "Calories, Food, Energy."}
{"id": 32, "Title": "Death of Obamas’ chef, Tafari Campbell, is ruled an accident", "Description": "The drowning death of Tafari Campbell, personal chef to Barack and Michelle Obama, was an accident, according to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Massachusetts.Timothy McGuirk, a spokesman for the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, said the commonwealth does not release autopsy results to the public. But McGuirk said the chief medical examiner ruled Tuesday that Campbell’s death was an accident. The former White House sous chef had drowned July 23 while paddle boarding on Edgartown Great Pond, near the Obamas’ home on Martha’s Vineyard, where Campbell, 45, had been visiting.The Boston Globe reported that “Campbell was standing on his paddleboard when he lost his balance and fell off. He struggled to remain afloat before slipping beneath the water. Campbell was not wearing a life jacket and wasn’t secured to his board. Campbell’s body was found in about 8 feet of water.”According to the Boston paper, on the evening of July 23, an unidentified woman wasn’t able to assist Campbell after she saw him go under. A rescue swimmer, presumably a separate person, also tried to find Campbell but could not, according to the Globe. Boat crews, dive teams and even a Coast Guard helicopter searched for Campbell that night, according to the paper. Campbell’s body was recovered the following morning.According to a spokeswoman for the former president and first lady, the Obamas “were not present at the residence at the time of the accident.”The Washington Post has not yet confirmed the details of the accident.Campbell’s death left his friends and loved ones in a state of shock. Tributes came from the Obamas, former White House chef and policy adviser Sam Kass, and many others who knew or worked with Campbell.A native of New York, Campbell studied the culinary arts at Northern Virginia Community College, Kass said. But Campbell also had mentors inside the White House kitchen, including executive chef Cristeta Comerford and assistant chef Tommy Kurpradit. Campbell cooked for two presidents as a sous chef from 2007 to 2016.Those who worked with Campbell noted not only his meticulous nature, but also his sense of humor.A post shared by Barack Obama (@barackobama)Campbell was also married to a chef. Sherise Campbell has her own baking and catering company called Sweet Sage. The couple have twin sons, Xavier and Savin, who are young adults.The Obamas had released a statement shortly after Campbell’s death, calling him “a beloved part of our family.”A few days later, Barack Obama issued another tribute on his Instagram account.“Tafari Campbell showed us what true character looks like. He believed that actions speak louder than words. And he used his immense gifts to bring people together, provide comfort, and spread joy,” the former president wrote. “I’ll miss him every day.”Emily Heil contributed to this report.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2023/08/22/tafari-campbell-drowning-death-ruling-accident/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 22, 2023", "Tag": "Delicious food", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 33, "Title": "Eggo’s ‘Brunch in a Jar’ sippin’ cream is a boozy, diabolical disaster", "Description": "In “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” the mad genius candy-maker Willy Wonka’s confections memorably include a “three-course dinner” chewing gum. The treat delivers to its chewers a succession of flavors that span an entire meal, starting with tomato soup, then moving on to roast beef and baked potatoes, and finally a blueberry pie and ice cream dessert — though Wonka boasted that it could taste like any other menu one might choose.I thought of this fictional creation when I first encountered waffle-maker Eggo’s new “Brunch in a Jar” drink, a boozy concoction whose Wonka-esque creators designed to impart all the tastes you might find on a combination platter at your local diner — “toasted Eggo waffles, sweet maple syrup and rich butter, with a hint of smoky bacon,” per the promotional materials — in a single glass. The drink is the product of a collaboration with Tennessee-based Sugarlands Distilling, whose rum-infused Appalachian Sippin’ Cream forms the base of the Eggo drink.While struggling to process this novel substance, I was appalled and curious in equal measure. Was this some kind of bizarre meal-replacement product, with the added bonus of a buzz (thanks to the 20 percent ABV)? No. Apparently it’s meant to be consumed alongside … real Eggo waffles in their solid form. And what in the name of Saint Dolly Parton is “sippin’ cream”? A visit to the company’s website reveals that it’s a rich beverage infused with dessert flavors including banana pudding and dark chocolate and coffee. These were not particularly reassuring answers.Even more baffling was the marketing of the Eggo-inspired drink to parents who can’t actually go out for brunch. “Mom and dad, this one is made specially for you,” the news release promises. “Between the juggle of constantly changing schedules, household errands, family outings or busy workdays, it can often feel impossible for parents to find moments they can savor for themselves,” Joe Beauprez, Kellogg’s senior director of marketing for frozen foods, said in the release. “Eggo Brunch in a Jar makes it easy for parents to kick back when they’re not caring for their little ones.”I pictured a couple desperately passing each other a jar of waffle-flavored booze in the moments before the kids arrive home from soccer practice, swigging from it as their eyes warily scan the driveway.Despite having no children to hide my own drinking from, I decided to give the concoction a try. (Okay, this wasn’t entirely my choice. My editors’ insistence might have played a small role in the matter.) I suspected it would be quite sweet, so I knew the keys to making it palatable would be making sure it was very cold — and keeping the serving size down. I scanned the recipes suggested on the website, most of which only added more sugar to the mix. One, dubbed “Morning Chaos,” which calls for the Eggo liquor to be mixed with rum, spiced chai syrup, pineapple juice and blood-orange juice, seemed particularly off-putting. I settled on the “L’Eggo With Eggo,” which adds less than an ounce to cold brew coffee and calls for a topping made with equal parts whipping cream and more of the Eggo booze.Tried on its own, served over ice, the liquor was even more of a quandary than I initially suspected. How, I wondered, could something simultaneously be acridly bitter and tooth-achingly sweet? I detected all of the promised food groups: faux buttery notes with a bit of smoke (the bacon, I suspected) and a kind of toasted-bread-like quality, all punched in the gut by an overwhelming dose of sharp imitation maple, as if Mrs. Butterworth was getting the better of everyone in a barroom brawl. The texture was viscous and mouth-coating, and I couldn’t imagine anyone drinking more than a sip they’d come to regret.In the cocktail — an espresso-martini-like mixture — it was more bearable, but only because it had been mercifully diluted by more than 4 to 1.The urge among food companies to booze-ify their offerings is apparently strong, no matter how improbable the resulting product. (See Arby’s french-fry-flavored vodka, Oreo Thins wine, Hellmann’s “mayo-nog” and the Velveeta martini.) And mash-ups — often done merely for the novelty factor — are an epidemic sweeping the culinary landscape. Kraft Mac & Cheese ice cream? French’s mustard-flavored Skittles? Twinkies cereal? Those are all real things, not the phantasms of a junk-food-loving fourth-grader’s fever dreams.The longer I contemplated the Eggo booze, the more annoyed I felt. I was irritated by the vague hillbilly cosplay of the container, a jar meant to conjure up moonshine, and the folksy droppin’ of the letter “g,” like it’s some fancy affectation of the elite. I was vexed by the marketers so eager to play Mad Libs with their products, inserting them into contexts no one asked for.When it comes to my brunch libations, please, Eggo, just l’eggo.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2023/08/22/eggo-brunch-in-a-jar-alcohol/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 22, 2023", "Tag": "Delicious food", "Keywords": "Waffle, Brunch, Cocktail."}
{"id": 34, "Title": "How a touch of Indian flavor can add spark to everyday meals", "Description": "Cookbook author Maya Kaimal can turn broccoli into a crave-worthy dish in minutes.The garlicky tadka broccoli from her new cookbook, “Indian Flavor Every Day,” serves as a delicious example of what she calls “applying the Indian touch” to common ingredients.First, she makes a tadka, a spice-infused oil. Kaimal heats oil in a skillet, then adds mustard seeds, cumin seeds and black sesame seeds until they sizzle and pop, followed by garlic and red chile flakes. The oil is ready in about three minutes, and is tossed with lightly stir-fried broccoli.Get the recipe: Red Chili Shrimp“You’re cooking with Indian flavors, but you’re making what you’re already making,” she said of the dish. Her latest book, which also includes streamlined Indian curries and dals, offers tips for using Indian spices even when not cooking Indian food, per se: slipping a pinch of garam masala into cookie dough or pie crust, or brushing ghee and chai spices on pineapple before grilling it.Kaimal, who has been on the food scene for more than 20 years, has watched as U.S. home cooks have become more comfortable with global cooking. That is reflected in the success of Maya Kaimal Foods, a business she started with her husband, journalist Guy Lawson, in 2003. It filled a gap in the U.S. market, she said. Many Indian food products at that time were imported from the United Kingdom and contained too much sugar and preservatives. Kaimal wanted to offer homemade flavor and natural ingredients.The couple now live with their two teenage daughters in New York’s Hudson Valley, where they employ 13 people in the business that sells what Kaimal calls “speed-scratch” sauces as well as dals, chanas and rice in more than 10,000 stores, including Target, Costco and Whole Foods.“So much has changed since I wrote my first book in 1996,” she said. “People are much savvier now about spices and how to use spices.”That cookbook, “Curried Favors,” was written as an introduction to Indian cooking when it was much harder to find the ingredients. Her second, “Savoring the Spice Coast of India,” published in 2000, focused on dishes from Kerala, where her father was born.Now, with the third book, the author and entrepreneur posits that with a pantry of the right ingredients — many with a long shelf life — “Indian flavors can be woven into your meals with delicious ease.”“I tried to take into account what dinner looks like on American tables,” she said. “I have a family to feed. I am running a business. I don’t want dinner to take a lot of my life, but I want a lot of these flavors in my everyday cooking.”Tadka — a spice-infused oil or ghee — can take any salad from ho-hum to flavorfulHer Red Chili Shrimp recipe, with its long ingredient list for a dry rub, sauce and tadka, is an example of how a recipe can look intimidating but come together in about 30 minutes. She hopes to encourage home cooks curious about Indian flavors and techniques to try dishes like this and discover how simple they can be.“It’s hopefully bringing in people who are right on the edge: They’re Indian-curious, but still intimidated by it.”She breaks the essential spice blends for tadkas and masalas into mini recipes within recipes and explains how to deploy them. She explains that tadkas, the infused oils, can be made at the start of cooking a dish or used to finish a recipe with a flavor boost. She offers recipes for masalas — dry or wet spice pastes that can be just a couple of ingredients or a dozen — and tells how to use them to layer flavor in various ways.Once home cooks gather the ingredients and understand those two concepts, they can apply “the Indian touch” to almost any meal.She credits her father, Chandran Kaimal, with building the foundation of her Indian cooking that led to her career in food. Her mother, Lorraine, who was from New England, cooked during the week, but on weekends, her father, a physicist, took over in the kitchen, making meticulous notes as he cooked.“He had to make sure things could be replicated like an experiment,” she said. “He paid so much attention to the flavor, dialing in an exact balance. We were eating his experiments every weekend.”Kaimal, who grew up in Boston and later Boulder, Colo., cooked from a binder of her father’s typed recipes throughout college and when she started a catering business. Those recipes helped her secure a publisher for her first cookbook, she said.They also provided comfort after her father died in 2021 and her mother in 2022.“It’s how we keep them alive and in our thoughts,” she said. It’s why even her father’s non-Indian recipes have been woven into her cookbooks, including the Southeast Asian dish Tangy Mee Goreng, a noodle stir-fry with vegetables, egg, and a light soy and vinegar sauce.Get the recipe: Tangy Mee GorengHer brother, Narayan Kaimal, found that recipe written in her father’s neat handwriting on an index card from the 1970s. When Kaimal’s father was little, his parents lived in Kuala Lumpur, Malaya (now Malaysia), where his mother made the dish for him and it became a favorite.“That’s a real ode to my father even though it is not technically Indian,” she said. “I remember watching him fry up the egg in that thin omelet way.

{"id": 35, "Title": "Roast cherry tomatoes to discover just how luscious they can be", "Description": "Should you find yourself in the enviable position of having too many cherry tomatoes — you got bedazzled at the farm stand, your garden is an overachiever or maybe the grocery store had a sale — here’s a strategy for you: Toss them on a sheet pan, drizzle exuberantly with olive oil, season and then roast at high heat.Along with plenty of olive oil, the intense heat transforms the tomatoes from simple and sweet to nuanced and deeply flavored. While not technically a “confit,” which means the ingredient has been slowly cooked in fat so it absorbs, and is partially preserved by it, the roasted tomatoes will be fragrant and luscious.Get the recipe: Roasted Cherry Tomato ConfitAny variety of cherry tomato will work well except “grape” type, which are not as juicy as their rounder cousins. If you want to use grape tomatoes, mix them with rounder varieties. To keep the consistency uniform and juicy, halve larger tomatoes and use a mix of colors and shapes. Each type of cherry tomato has its own personality; I highly recommend Sungolds — for an eye-catching complex-tasting confit.For seasoning, I generally stick to salt, but a bit of cracked black pepper, Aleppo pepper or dried chile flakes would be nice. For herbs, I like thyme, rosemary or both, but marjoram, oregano or savory also work well. Tender, leafy herbs — such as tomato’s BFF basil — should be added after cooking to avoid burning. Whole garlic cloves can also be dreamy, provided they don’t burn; you may need to do some scooching to keep them bathed in oil and juice.You may find yourself eating the finished confit right from the sheet pan, but hold back — the destinations for roasted tomato confit are many and varied, and include any dish that would benefit from its sweet-tart flavor and the richness of the olive oil and tomato juice.Here are a few ideas:Get the recipe: Roasted Cherry Tomato Confit", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2023/08/22/how-to-roast-cherry-tomatoes/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 22, 2023", "Tag": "Delicious food", "Keywords": "Roasted Tomatoes, Olive Oil, Garlic."}
{"id": 36, "Title": "7 recipes with kimchi that show its spicy, funky versatility", "Description": "Kimchi, available in the refrigerated section of many large grocery stores, is a flavor powerhouse. Often made with napa cabbage, the fermented Korean staple instantly adds layers of complex spice and tang to anything it touches. (Note that it often contains fish sauce or shrimp, so look for vegan versions if those ingredients don’t fit your dietary needs.) On top of its delicious taste, kimchi also provides nutritional benefits because “as a fermented food, it is a source of gut-friendly probiotics — good bacteria that are not only good for digestive health but also help the immune system in general,” Nourish columnist Ellie Krieger wrote.I love to keep it in my kitchen to top bowls of grains and noodles, stir into soups and stews, and toss with stir fries.

{"id": 37, "Title": "At a Jersey Shore bar, Taco Tuesday’s soul lives on in a trademark", "Description": "SOMERS POINT, N.J. — Gregory Gregory is a man of many titles: a grandfather, a Jersey Shore restaurateur and raconteur, a 71-year-old with the same first and last name.He caught a 985-pound alligator with a beef lung as bait, helped reel in a 600-pound marlin and killed a bear with just a long bow and a wooden arrow from less than 30 feet away. He tells tales of the three resident ghosts who supposedly haunt Gregory’s Restaurant & Bar, previously a World War II-era brothel less than 20 miles from Atlantic City. The specters include an uncle named Eddie, a customer with a love of snapper soup and a lady of the evening who was stabbed in the bordello days.But he is best known for something else: Gregory has promoted the bar as the home of the original Taco Tuesday, as well as the country’s first trademarked use of a phrase that’s grown into a weekly American cultural phenomenon. Since that first Taco Tuesday night in 1979, Gregory estimates that the bar has served more than 2 million tacos in what has become a Somers Point tradition for generations of families and singles on a budget, and 20-somethings needing to soak up the booze and bad decisions.It’s a custom that comes in the form of two hard-shell ground beef tacos with taco seasoning, lettuce, tomatoes and shredded cheddar cheese that Gregory’s serves with a spork in a red basket and sells for $3.50. And it has all happened under a trademark that Gregory, who amusingly doesn’t like tacos or Mexican food and hasn’t eaten a taco in decades, has owned for more than 40 years.“A South Jersey taco is a Gregory’s taco,” Gregory told The Washington Post. “It’s a culinary delight, but it’s one of a kind.”With that delight comes doubt about what’s ahead for the ritual that has made Gregory’s a Garden State institution. The future of Gregory’s Taco Tuesday trademark in the state of New Jersey now faces uncertainty amid Taco Bell’s petition to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in May seeking to cancel the trademark. Taco Bell, which serves more than 40 million customers in the United States each week, has argued that the Taco Tuesday phrase has become so generic that the trademark should be liberated to allow any of the hundreds of restaurants, bars and cantinas in the country that already ignore the Taco Tuesday trademark to use it in their marketing without fear of any potential legal action.In July, Taco John’s, a Wyoming-based chain that operates almost 400 restaurants, gave up its right to the trademark in 49 states, which it had owned since 1989. In a statement to The Post, Taco Bell CEO Mark King said that while the chain was thrilled Taco John’s had abandoned its Taco Tuesday trademark, “we remain committed to freeing Taco Tuesday everywhere, including in New Jersey.”“We stand by our belief that Taco Tuesday belongs to all who make, sell, eat and celebrate tacos,” King said. A spokesperson for Taco John’s did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Taco Bell’s legal push to liberate the phrase, which has included the marketing help of NBA great and Taco Tuesday enthusiast LeBron James, has left Gregory with the last trademark of its kind in the country in what he described as a modern-day David vs. Goliath story.Taco Bell has responded by saying it would offer customers free Doritos Locos Tacos on each Tuesday through Sept. 5.“Every day is taco day at Taco Bell, so I don’t know why they have to take Taco Tuesday from us,” said Steve Altamuro, a family friend and attorney for Gregory in the legal fight against Taco Bell. “They have Taco Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, you name it. I don’t know what they’re trying to accomplish.”The trademark battle also has Gregory thinking what it could mean in the long term for a small business open since 1946 that has proclaimed itself as the home of the country’s original Taco Tuesday.“I just want everybody to know that we started Taco Tuesday,” he said.When Gregory and his partner, Walt, were set to take over the family business in 1979, he wanted to see what it was that people were waiting in line for at a stand inside Philadelphia’s Gallery mall. Gregory, then 26 and working at a beer and liquor store at the mall, finally got to the front of the line and uttered a sentence to the lady behind the counter that would change the trajectory of his life.“I’ll have a take-o.”“She says: ‘It’s taco. It’s Tex-Mex,’” he remembered about the day he ate his first taco. His excitement, however, was short-lived. “I take a bite — and I couldn’t eat it. It was horrible, awful,” he said, noting he’s hated cumin ever since. “But the long line continued every day, so I knew they were on to something.”After Gregory unsuccessfully tried to make tacos a permanent part of the menu in January 1979, he persuaded his partner and family to have tacos available once a week as a promotion.“I wanted to do it on Tuesday because Wednesday was ‘Drink and Drown’ at Tony Mart’s, which had 50-cent drinks, and the place was always packed,” Gregory said, referring to the famous dance club. “I wanted to cut their legs off and get the people into our place so they could have their big power load on Tuesday rather than the night after when they’re not feeling up to it.”The owner got a buddy of his from Texas to show him how to make the tacos. Gregory found a salsa recipe from inside the pages of a Playboy magazine from 1978. Gregory decided on hard shells, which were popularized in the United States by places like Taco Bell and used in Tex-Mex and other restaurants, over the more traditional-in-Mexico soft shells.On Feb. 6, 1979, they sold five orders — then three for $1 — on that first Taco Tuesday. The second week, they sold eight.“Nobody knew what they were,” he said.So when Gregory made a run to Philadelphia to buy 200 corn taco shells, he thought that would last him through the month. Then, on the third week, they sold 70 orders, or 210 tacos, and Gregory had to make the last tacos out of soft tortillas.“I thought, ‘Holy smokes, there’s a line out the door of 30 people trying to come in,’” said Paul Gregory, one of Gregory’s sons and chefs who now runs the bar along with his brother, Joe. “It fit the bar perfectly.”Everyone in Somers Point now knew about Taco Tuesday.The history of who came up with Taco Tuesday has long been in dispute.Gustavo Arellano, a Los Angeles Times columnist and author of the 2012 book “Taco USA: How Mexican Food Conquered America,” reported in Thrillist that an El Paso business was promoting tacos sold on Tuesdays as early as 1933. Newspaper clippings from across the United States — Arizona, Minnesota, Utah, Wisconsin — show businesses promoting tacos on Tuesday. The earliest documented use of the phrase Taco Tuesday came from a 1973 newspaper ad in Rapid City, S.D., promoting three tacos for $1 at the Snow White Drive-In.Gregory Gregory said he had never heard of Taco Tuesday before the bar launched the promotion in 1979.“It rolled off the tongue, just like Gregory Gregory,” he said, referring to how his father gave him the same first and last name.By 1981, Jack Spellman saw the long lines and believed Gregory needed to stake a legal claim on Taco Tuesday. Spellman, a professor who taught Gregory public speaking at what was then called Atlantic Community College, recommended that his former student file for a trademark until Spellman himself brought the paperwork for him to sign.“He said: ‘You have to get a trademark. This is a phenomenon, this is crazy,’” Gregory said. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office recognized the Taco Tuesday trademark for Gregory Hotel Inc., the bar’s parent company, on Oct. 19, 1982.As the bar was gaining more recognition, Gregory admits he has jokingly called other restaurants in the state he’s heard running their own Taco Tuesday promotions to remind them that he’s got the trademark. But he almost lost it entirely in 1989, when he lapsed on renewing the trademark, and Taco John’s was awarded it from the patent office. The bar and the chain eventually came to an agreement that gave Taco John’s ownership of the trademark in the 49 other states, while Gregory’s had a simple request.“We just wanted New Jersey,” the owner said.As groups of people trickle in from the beach for a lunch break in early August, they are greeted with an orange bar menu in comic sans font that has a typo for its most well-known dish — “TWO BEFF TACOS” — at the “HOME OF THE ORIGINAL TACO TUESDAY® SINCE 1979.” The lunch line here on this day is busier than at the Taco Bell location about a mile away.Paul Gregory recalled how Taco Tuesday had gotten so big at Gregory’s by around 2003 that they ran a taco-eating contest that eventually had to end because the hard corn shells were choking hazards that were also causing some people to bleed, all in hope of winning a surfboard or a bike.“You had to drink a beer afterward and it got a little ugly,” he said.Gregory Gregory has had fun in the past with those who’ve challenged the trademark. When James made an unsuccessful attempt to claim the trademark in 2019, the bar’s marquee poked fun at the NBA superstar: “C’mon, LeBron.” After James’s son, Bronny, recently suffered cardiac arrest, Gregory made the sign read, “Our prayers are with LeBron’s son.” “I’m in the fun business, I’m not in the nasty business,” he said.But the good vibes at Gregory’s were upended when Taco Bell came after it and Taco John’s in May. Gregory said he was shocked that the legal challenge was unfolding — and even more surprised when Taco John’s folded as quickly as it did and gave up the Taco Tuesday trademark in the 49 other states.Gregory acknowledges he does not know how long his business can keep up a legal fight with a conglomerate like Taco Bell, especially if the legal expenses creep into the range of six figures. Altamuro, his attorney who regularly practices more in estate and personal injury cases, said they’ve been contacted by other attorneys willing to work with them pro bono or at a reduced rate, but no one has signed on yet to help in the fight.“Greg has had some preliminary conversations with Taco Bell, so we’ll see if they want to go to the mattresses or find a mutual resolution,” said Altamuro, referencing a famous scene from “The Godfather.”Gregory, wearing a black Gregory’s Taco Tuesday polo with an embroidered sombrero and Dos Equis logo, fears that the loss of the New Jersey trademark would be a crushing blow to a business that’s had its paydays for employees on Wednesdays because of the decades-long success of the promotion. He hopes he can come to an agreement with Taco Bell where the chain somehow acknowledges Gregory’s and its claim to the trademark that it might be forced to give up.But he can’t think about that now, because he needs to get back to work. It is Taco Tuesday, and tacos are still on the menu.“It’s Gregory’s Mexican food — olé,” he said in his South Jersey accent. “When people go to other places, they’ll say, ‘We had tacos in California and they don’t even look like yours.’ And I’d just say, ‘Well, ours are ours.’”", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2023/08/21/taco-tuesday-trademark-gregorys-taco-bell/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 21, 2023", "Tag": "Delicious food", "Keywords": "1.

I have readers to thank for pointing me in the direction of a new barbecue spot in Northern Virginia and a fresh seafood attraction in Delaware.Think of the following restaurants as souvenirs — edible memories from my trips.When a good chef gives me a hot tip, I bite. Puzukan Tan, a sleek Korean barbecue in Falls Church, Va., landed on my radar thanks to one of the owners of the popular Anju in Washington, Danny Lee, who texted that he wasn’t the only chef to sing the praises of the young restaurant: “What’s an even better endorsement is that my mom loves it!”When a good chef gives me a hot tip, I bite. Puzukan Tan, a sleek Korean barbecue in Falls Church, Va., landed on my radar thanks to one of the owners of the popular Anju in Washington, Danny Lee, who texted that he wasn’t the only chef to sing the praises of the young restaurant: “What’s an even better endorsement is that my mom loves it!”1/2Any Day Now shines from morning to nightThe selections are all you can eat for $55, which lets you choose from more than a dozen meats and comes with a 90-minute cutoff, and a choice of four or eight cuts for $69 and $135 for two, respectively. Diners can also order dishes a la carte.The $69 combination yields a feast for two, considering the meal gets rounded out with clear and comforting beef-radish soup, corn under a cloak of molten mozzarella and steamed eggs, light as clouds (but hot as Hades, so watch out). Our server got a serious workout tending to our choices on the grill: smoked pork belly, baby back ribs, curry-swabbed pork belly, marinated kalbi that was unfurled like a carpet — meat so luscious it didn’t need the distraction of nearby sauces.Puzukan translates from Korean to “butcher shop.” Tan refers to “charcoal.” The name of the restaurant signals the owners’ priorities. The beef and pork are not only cuts above much of the competition, they’re curated by Sangdon Han, a longtime butcher for H Mart, the sprawling Asian supermarket chain. The Kims also use a hybrid cooking system, whereby charcoal is added to the gas grills set in each table, a detail that adds pleasing smokiness to the meat.You don’t need to grill to appreciate the place. I’m just as likely to return for a bowl of soy bean stew. The burnt-orange soup — teasing with heat and thick with creamy tofu, ruffles of brisket, jalapeños and chunks of potatoes and cucumbers — bubbles like lava as it lands on your table and eats like home cooking. The base is created from beef bones, gochujang and soybeans purchased from Korean farmers in Maryland then crushed, together with tofu, for creamy, comforting effect. This is my kind of Seoul food.Puzukan Tan introduced me to something new: bulgogi “sushi.” Kibum says the foot-long rope of rice topped with shredded beef and served on a slender wooden plank was created for “beginners and kids.” I don’t fall in either camp, but I easily polished off half the spectacle.8114 Arlington Blvd., Falls Church, Va. 571-395-4727. puzukantan.com.

A taste of turmeric-tinted yellow lentils leads to a bite of dark green collards, sparked with garlic and ginger, which segues to naturally sweet carrots and cabbage. I love the fire started by berbere in the red lentils, which, like everything on the platter, is scooped up with scrolls of supple injera. (For extra, you can get the crepe-like bread made with iron-rich teff. Gluten-free injera is also an option.)As for meat, if I’m not eating kitfo, Ethiopia’s salute to steak tartare, I’m molding pieces of injera around crusty bites of lamb tossed with sweet onions and heat-packing jalapeños, or tibs wot, cubed beef in a dark red blanket of berbere, onions, butter and korekima, the Ethiopian spice known as “false cardamom” because of its floral and citrusy notes. The lamb and the beef are among the meat attractions on a menu that’s more concise than on prior visits, but just as enticing.811 Roeder Rd., Silver Spring, Md. betethiopia.com. 301-588-2225.

Yes, it’s crowded. Oui, it’s clattery. Still, I appreciate the genial and efficient service and the timeless look of the place, dressed with coffered ceiling and walls the color of mint. A friend from New Orleans compares Chez Billy Sud, poised to turn 10 next year, to something she’d find back home, in a city known for romantic restaurants. I second her opinion as I steal bites of her pâté, a lusty slab of pork shoulder and belly, chicken liver spiked with Armagnac and punctuation from dried apricots and pistachios — a treasure in every bite.The restaurant emerged from a months-long, $400,000 renovation in May with something to please cooks and diners alike: a reconfigured kitchen with new equipment and a 16-seat private dining room upstairs, whose rich wallpaper chef Brendan L’Etoile likens to The Shire in “The Lord of the Rings.”While I come for what’s familiar — the city’s tallest salad verte, sea bass with crisp green beans and brown butter sauce — I always look forward to L’Etoile’s innovations. Goat cheese swirled with garlic and brandy and fragrant with lavender brings Provence to Washington, and a parfait of rice pudding snaps, crackles and pops with an assist from lightly sugared Rice Krispies.1039 31st St. NW. 202-337-8852. chezbillysud.com.

The chef’s “dinner party” tasting menu lets you choose something from the rotisserie, visible behind a glass window, and sit back while the kitchen sends out the lot: gougères, a vegetable, the aforementioned scallop crudo, a choice between steak or halibut, and dessert. “A lot of people don’t like to make decisions,” says Petonito, who lets them sample much of the menu for $85 a person.Owner Hollis Wells Silverman wants the dining room near Eastern Market to “feel like someone’s home,” and sure enough, the combination of caramel-colored leather chairs, arty wooden lights and strategically placed coffee table books do just that.

The youngest of my companions entertained himself with a tiny pirate flag, plucked from a barge of a banana split, while his parents and I occupied ourselves with the lighter blueberry icebox cake, fashioned from Maine’s finest and pastry cream atop a graham cracker crust. Lemon zest, ginger and spoonfuls of whipped cream add to the fun.Only in Bethesda will diners find a split toasted bun cradling fresh peekytoe crab, bound with mayo, minced celery and citrus-y yuzukosho, and what Bailey considers his favorite dish on the menu: a salad composed of grilled giant squid from the Pacific, biting arugula and hot cherry peppers atop a swab of garlic aioli.

{"id": 39, "Title": "A broccoli salad with curry vinaigrette and apple has us craving fall", "Description": "This morning, I stepped outside and, for one shining moment, my skin experienced an ephemeral shiver. It wasn’t exactly cold out — more like the mid-70s — but as a refreshing breeze blew my way, I felt that tiny chill, and I said to myself three of my favorite words: Fall is coming.I know, I know. Autumn is still technically a month away. And here in the Mid-Atlantic, by the time you read this we’ll be back into the mid-90s. But I caught a whiff of the season to come — my favorite season, hands down — and started dreaming of the foods that will be back on my table once the shorts go back in storage and the jackets come out.Get the recipe: Broccoli Salad With Curry VinaigretteAs a gardener, I’m usually looking ahead, anyhow, thinking about what plants can thrive after they germinate and sprout in a few weeks, and I start to plan my cooking around them. When you live someplace that gets this hot in the summers (more and more of the world as the planet warms), one of the great seasonal cooking ironies is that at just the moment you are most interested in eating salads, it’s the absolute hardest to grow salad greens. My lettuces bolted and turned bitter a month ago, but I’m eyeing the calendar for the right time to start sowing new rounds of lettuce, spinach and arugula seeds for a fall bounty.1/2Until then, of course, I buy greens at the supermarket, and have been making salads that get heartier by the week. One I can’t stop making is from the inimitable Jeanine Donofrio’s latest book, “Love & Lemons Simple Feel Good Food.” It combines spinach with roast broccoli, apple (or pear), pumpkin seeds and dates, drizzled in an excellent curry vinaigrette. The dressing, punchy with garlic and ginger and curry powder, gets a touch of sweetness from more dates, and makes the salad as appropriate for special occasions as for any given weeknight. One of the (many) times I’ve made it was when I was looking for something to serve alongside a big pot of lentil soup for a colleague’s recent going-away celebration, and it worked wonders.Broccoli and spinach feel like seasonless ingredients, but the apple — while available any time — clues you in to the idea that this salad might be particularly welcome in not only the season we’re in, but the one that’s on the horizon, ready to give you the chills you’ve craved all summer long.Get the recipe: Broccoli Salad With Curry Vinaigrette", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2023/08/20/broccoli-salad-jeanine-donofrio-love-and-lemons/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 20, 2023", "Tag": "Delicious food", "Keywords": "Keywords: Fall, Salad, Curry Vinaigrette."}

{"id": 41, "Title": "Nabisco chocolate wafers are no more. We found the best alternative.", "Description": "Icebox cake fans and cookie pie crust lovers are in mourning: Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers are no more.Introduced in 1924 and responsible for popularizing icebox cakes, the cookies were “delisted” this year according to a representative from Mondelez International, Nabisco’s parent company. And to rub salt on the wound, the reliable alternative that I’ve used in the past, 365 by Whole Foods Market Brownie Cookie Thins, is also no longer being carried by the grocery chain.But all is not lost! For icebox cakes in particular, almost any cookie or cracker can be used to assemble the no-bake desserts, and there are plenty of alternatives to make chocolate cookie crusts for pies and cheesecakes. Here’s a rundown of some of the options, along with our top pick as a near dupe for the Famous Chocolate Wafers. (R.I.P.)5 icebox cake recipes for cool, no-bake dessertsChocolate graham crackers. Unfortunately, these have also become more difficult to find recently. (Is there some sort of chocolate cookie conspiracy going on?) Instead of the standard large rectangles, much of what I see available at supermarkets and online are small animal shapes, which would make them easy for layering in an icebox cake. One thing to keep in mind flavor-wise is that you’ll have to contend with the whole wheat graham flour and honey flavorings in your desserts. (Kodiak Chocolate Graham Bear Bites Price: $6 / 9 ounces online)1/3Tate’s Bake Shop Double Chocolate Chip Cookies. These are the sweetest of the bunch — perhaps a result of the semisweet chocolate chips they’re studded with — so you might want to adjust other components when using in a recipe. And while these could work in icebox cakes (the chocolate chips might be an issue if you’re trying to blend into a crust), I’d rather enjoy them as-is with a cold glass of milk. (Tate’s took top prize in our store-bought chocolate chip cookie taste test a few years ago.) (Price: $6.29 / 7 ounces at Streets Market)Goya Maria Chocolate Cookies. Subtly sweet, these traditional Spanish-style biscuits are extremely versatile and would work great in any recipe. On the flip side, they lack the rich chocolate flavor that Nabisco’s wafers were famous for. (Price: $1.49 / 7 ounces at Streets Market)Simple Mills Chocolate Brownie Sweet Thins. If you are gluten free, these are the cookies for you. They’re made from a seed-and-nut-flour blend and offer a decent amount of chocolate flavor with a nice snap. And because they’re on the smaller end of the spectrum, similar to the animal-shaped graham crackers, they would be easy to layer in icebox cakes. (Price: $4.01 / 4.25 ounces on Amazon)For creamy cheesecake with no cracks — or water bath — bake it low and slowOreo Thins. When the Mondelez rep (they also own Oreo) mentioned these as a replacement for their discontinued wafers, I was initially skeptical. Surely they simply wanted to plug another one of their products. But then I realized that they have a similar size and bittersweet chocolate flavor as the Famous Chocolate Wafers. The thin layer of cream in the middle makes them perhaps a touch sweeter, but it’s negligible. And while you might think that cream would be an issue in recipes, Jessie Sheehan, author of the “Icebox Cakes” cookbook, said in an Instagram Reel that the cream will just blend into a cookie crust or sort of melt into the whipped cream of an icebox cake. Plus, of all of the options listed here, these cookies will be the easiest to find for most people. (Price: $4.99 / 10.1 ounces at Target)Dewey’s Bakery Brownie Crisp Cookies. If you want a cookie that is almost identical in both shape and flavor to the Famous Chocolate Wafers (based off memory, as we couldn’t find any to do a side-by-side comparison) — this is it. Founded in 1930 in Winston-Salem, N.C., this once-local bakery went nationwide in 2018. The brand is sold at large chains such as Albertsons and Safeway, and they can be ordered online if you can’t source them from your local grocery store. These thin, crispy, chocolaty, bittersweet cookies would be great layered with cream in an icebox cake or blitzed into a pie crust. Or, I’d be just as happy snacking on them with a cup of coffee or shoveling them into my mouth by the handful for a sweet snack.

{"id": 42, "Title": "Any Day Now shines from morning to night", "Description": "The breakout star of Any Day Now, the new all-day cafe from chefs Tim Ma and Matt Sperber, is the breakfast sandwich swaddled in a housemade scallion pancake.“We thought if we sold 50, we’d pat ourselves on the back,” on opening day June 1, says Sperber, 32, Ma’s business partner and chef de cuisine. “By 11:30 we were sold out.” At the same time the next day, all 150 sandwiches produced by the Navy Yard kitchen were gone. Shortly after 10 a.m. that Saturday, Ma went outside to tell a hungry crowd there was nothing more to sell after the restaurant made 217 hot pockets. By Sunday, Any Day Now pumped out nearly 300 orders — before noon.1/2“It was a blessing we didn’t anticipate,” says Sperber, and the chief reason for pushing back dinner service until late July. The sandwiches, which start with a labor-intensive dough and get filled with steamed egg and a choice of bacon, sausage or kimchi, live up to the frenzy. In my experience, crackle gives way to tender egg and melted cheese, a sensation enlivened by a dip in the accompanying garlic-chili soy sauce. Recipients are truly sorry when the last sesame-oiled crumb is dispatched. The only reason I didn’t get back in line for a second round is because the sandwiches are griddled to order, they take about 10 minutes — and I had a lunch reservation on the horizon.Lots of fans have trumpeted the praises of the Taylor Swift of sandwiches. I’m here to tell you evenings offer plenty of entertainment, too.Dinner was actually my first visit to the restaurant, which follows ABC Pony in its space. Little on the menu at Any Day Now reads unusual; lots of places serve tuna tartare, barbecue spare ribs and burgers. Yet this is the only place I’ve encountered diced raw tuna with blue cheese in the same dish, a novelty that took me no time to finish once I tasted the combination.Drift elevates beach food with stellar seafood and serviceAhead of their joint venture, Ma, 45, dug up menus from his many previous restaurants — American Son, Kyirisan, Water & Wall and Maple Avenue, among others — gave them to Sperber for reference, and told him to apply his own story to whatever dishes he envisioned for Any Day Now. Sperber, who left the Salt Line in Ballston to work with Ma at Lucky Danger, Ma’s American Chinese takeout, is a New Jersey native whose favorite childhood food memories embraced family trips to diners.Which is how Any Day Now’s atypical tuna tartare came about: Sperber wanted to both riff on a classic tuna melt and offer an alternative to beef tartare. Diced tuna is bound with mayonnaise, miso, cold-smoked egg and blue cheese, which imparts a meaty note, and spread across a raft of toast, which is finished with a carpet of minced scallions and pickled mushrooms — perfect ping. For sure, the combination is different. But intriguing, too, and an example of the “polished casual” approach Sperber says he is aiming for here.Servers steer customers toward certain dishes by flagging their inspiration. The cucumber salad, a waiter says, “is like a gyro.” Sure enough, the small plate gathers all the makings for the Greek staple: chunks of cucumber arranged with merguez and feta cheese, both made in-house, along with fresh mint and sourdough croutons for contrasting texture. The salad sits on a puddle of toum mixed with tahini and eats like a gyro — a gyro sent to finishing school, that is.Tom Sietsema’s 6 favorite places to eat right nowSperber says he loves honey walnut shrimp served at Chinese restaurants. His version swaps in fried calamari, which he scatters with black walnut crumble and arranges with broccoli, typically a garnish. Instead of serving the vegetable steamed, though, he chars it, for depth of flavor, but also to give it a more prominent role.The menu is small but inclusive. Steamed rockfish, which a server compares to clam chowder, delivers on the promise with a moat of diced potatoes, bacon and milky sauce around the entree, freckled with scallion ash, a handy way to deal with the abundance of scallions in the kitchen. Oxtail tagliatelle is a mash-up between the beef lo mein offered at Lucky Danger and Taiwanese beef noodle soup, a Ma childhood memory. Any Italian preconceptions are erased by the inclusion of five-spice powder, fermented pineapple and fresh mint. Busy at it sounds, forks go into over-twirl.Ma says people should “eat to be challenged” instead of ordering something they can get at home. Spare ribs of the size that tipped the Flintstones’ car are in fact daunting but delicious, glazed in a guava barbecue sauce I probably wouldn’t whip up in my own kitchen. The hulk, confited in brown butter, comes to the table on potatoes that taste like equal parts butter and Yukon Golds, their silky texture achieved by a pass through a fine-meshed strainer.Ma says he likes adding a little mystery to the familiar. What look like mozzarella sticks turn out to be stretchy with potatoes, too, and what appears to be marinara sauce is in fact tomato gravy tinted with turmeric. The oceanic taste in the dressing for the fetching green papaya “Caesar” salad is not anchovy, but nori. Another welcome vegetarian dish is katsu, in which breaded eggplant replaces the usual pork or chicken cutlet, and I’m reminded that Sperber also cooked at the much-missed Momofuku in CityCenter. The centerpiece, marinated in mirin, sake, miso and sugar, shares its bowl with shredded carrots, bright green pickles, pickled red onions and gold pickled fennel — a riot of colors and flavors atop a dusky curry broth.The owners want you to know their captivating omelet “is not from ‘The Bear,’” says Ma, never mind that the tender yellow picture arrives with a similar rich filling (sour cream and onions in this case) and crushed potato chips. Black truffles and caviar explain the item’s “fancy” menu designation, $25 price tag and good reason for sharing as an appetizer.This is a kitchen that likes to repurpose ideas. Did you expect the hamburger to be bound in anything but a scallion pancake? The effect is like eating potato chips with every bite of sandwich, a joyous meld of American cheese, crusty patty and “special sauce” that resembles McDonald’s, save for the wasabi tease slipped in. Light, beer-battered onion rings extend the pleasure.In contrast, the one dish that a table of food lovers merely picked at: fried chicken atop okonomiyaki, or stuffed Japanese pancake. The riff on chicken and waffles was too dense, too sweet.Busy with his takeout venues, Laoban Dumplings (sold at Sprouts and Whole Foods) and combating anti-Asian violence through his nonprofit Chefs Stopping AAPI Hate, Ma debated jumping back into full-service restaurants. He reconsidered after he thought about his family legacy; his uncle, Paul Ma, an immigrant from China, was so instrumental in teaching customers about regional Chinese cooking at his restaurant, Paul Ma’s China Kitchen outside of New York City in the 1970s and 1980s, that he was honored with inclusion in an exhibition, “Food: Transforming the American Table,” at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History.Joon showcases the glories and grace of the Iranian kitchenTim Ma ultimately decided he had to “finish what I started doing,” despite the industry’s challenges in the wake of the pandemic. Any Day Now is the uncommon restaurant to be open on Monday and give workers two consecutive days off in the middle of the week, but it is also the increasingly frequent business to withhold a phone number. (The wine collector in my posse had to wait until arrival to learn the corkage fee: $35.)Kitty corner from the Capitol Skyline hotel, the dining room, separated from the bar by a see-through bookshelf, is as relaxed as the food is fun. By day, the botanical-topped tables and low couches are populated by almost as many laptops as sandwich eaters and coffee sippers. (The morning of my epiphany, Ma was working by his lonesome at the bar.) Come evening, a layer of sophistication is applied as cocktails take the place of coffee cups.Stick around for an $8 dessert. The kitchen puts out a super-moist carrot cake veined with golden raisins and a yuzu curd pie topped with lightly torched waves of meringue. Apple pie can be ordered “a la Ma.” Expecting an inside joke or backstory, I was a little disappointed to discover it’s just vanilla ice cream.Ma says he opened Any Day Now with a mission — “Let’s be really good at one thing” — accomplished by the line-prompting breakfast sandwich.

{"id": 43, "Title": "Donald Trump marks return to X, formerly Twitter, with mug shot tweet", "Description": "Former president Donald Trump made a return to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, late Thursday, with his account sharing his mug shot and a link to his website hours after his surrender and subsequent release from an Atlanta jail on charges connected to his attempts to reverse the 2020 election results in Georgia.“Never surrender,” the caption read.https://t.co/MlIKklPSJT pic.twitter.com/Mcbf2xozsYTrump’s account had been suspended by the social media platform after the Jan. 6, 2021, riots, over concern about “risk of further incitement of violence.” Elon Musk reinstated the account in November after purchasing the platform, but Trump had not tweeted since. He launched his own social network, Truth Social, in February 2022 and has mostly used that platform. He also shared the mug shot there just before the post on X.Trump surrenders at Fulton County Jail for his first mug shotThe return of Trump on X, where he has more than 86 million followers, came as he was booked on charges he broke Georgia laws with his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, producing the first mug shot of a former U.S. president. It also came ahead of a new presidential election cycle in which he faces three other indictments.The post was met with celebrations from his supporters, one of whom said that this tweet would go on to become the “most viewed” in the platform’s history. (Trump’s tweet had 17.6 million views by 11 p.m.).Musk shared the tweet, writing: “Next-level.”It remains unclear how active Trump will be on the site, which for years was inextricably linked with his political identity. During his presidency he used the site as a megaphone: amplifying his political agenda, commenting on foreign affairs or simply praising himself. He also promoted conspiracy theories, branded media outlets as enemies of the people and targeted minorities with his tweets and retweets.Previously Trump had said that he would not rejoin Twitter, which Musk rebranded as X this year. “The response on TRUTH is much better than being on Twitter,” he told Fox News in April 2022.During negotiations for an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson this month, Trump told advisers he didn’t want the interview to show up on X because it competes with Truth Social. Carlson and his team, who had been developing ties with Musk and X for months, balked, telling Trump that his social media platform didn’t have enough reach to do justice to such a high-profile interview.Trump once reconsidered sticking with Truth Social. Now he’s stuck.Other social media platforms that banned Trump after Jan. 6, 2021, have also restored the former president’s accounts in the more than 2½ years since his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, despite pushback from some civil rights groups that have demanded a permanent ban.A recent report by Accountable Tech, a nonprofit that advocates for better security and integrity in big tech, found that 360 of Trump’s posts on Truth Social would be in violation of Facebook’s Community Standards, dozens contained election-related disinformation and more than 100 posts amplify followers or supporters of QAnon.In January, Meta, Facebook’s parent company, announced it was lifting its ban. In March, YouTube followed suit.Hours after the Google-owned video site restored the account, Trump posted to both platforms.

{"id": 44, "Title": "Judge tosses Republicans’ lawsuit accusing Google’s spam filters of bias", "Description": "A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a Republican National Committee lawsuit alleging that Google’s email spam filters illegally suppressed their missives, dealing the campaign group a crushing blow in a lengthy battle that has riled conservative lawmakers in Washington.U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Calabretta wrote that while it was a “close case,” the RNC had not “sufficiently pled that Google acted in bad faith” by filtering their messages into spam filters in its popular Gmail service. Calabretta further ruled that Section 230, the embattled law that largely shields digital services from lawsuits over third-party content they host or moderate, protected Google from the claim.In 2022, Republicans seized on an academic study finding that Google’s filtering algorithms demonstrated a bias against conservative candidates, reigniting claims that the tech giant’s technology tips the electoral scales toward liberals by targeting voices on the right. Tech companies have long disputed the allegations.The study also found that rival email services Outlook and Yahoo demonstrated a less pronounced political bias against liberals, and its authors told The Washington Post that GOP leaders had taken their findings out of context.Republican officials publicly and privately blasted Google over the findings, arguing that it could hurt their efforts to fundraise over email and the party’s election chances overall.In a bid to assuage the criticisms, Google developed a pilot program to allow candidates’ emails to bypass their spam filters, earning a greenlight for the initiative from federal regulators.But in October, the political committee filed a lawsuit against Google accusing the tech giant of “discriminating” by “throttling its email messages” over its political views. In January, Google discontinued the program as it continued to fight the RNC’s lawsuit in court.“The RNC is wrong,” Google wrote in a motion at the time. “Gmail’s spam filtering policies apply equally to emails from all senders, whether they are politically affiliated or not.”The judge granted the RNC a chance to amend the lawsuit in part to establish a claim that the company had acted with a “lack of good faith.” The committee said it plans to refile an amended complaint.“This case is not over,” RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement, adding that the lawsuit “represents a crucial action against Big Tech’s anti-conservative bias.”“We welcome the Court’s finding that there are no plausible allegations that Gmail’s spam filters discriminate for political purposes,” Google spokesman José Castañeda said in a statement. “We will continue investing in spam-filtering technologies that protect people from unwanted emails while still allowing senders to reach the inboxes of users who want their messages.”The FEC dismissed a separate complaint brought by Republican campaign groups against Google over the allegations earlier this year.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/24/rnc-google-lawsuit-dismissed-spam-filter/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 24, 2023 at 5:38 p.m. EDT", "Tag": "Technology", "Keywords": "Keywords: Republican National Committee, Gmail, Section 230."}
{"id": 45, "Title": "Justice Department accuses SpaceX of hiring bias against refugees", "Description": "The Justice Department sued Elon Musk’s SpaceX on Thursday, alleging the company routinely discriminated against refugees and asylum seekers in its hiring process.According to the lawsuit, SpaceX officials said on numerous occasions between 2018 and last year that it could hire only U.S. citizens and green-card holders because of restrictive export control laws governing the use of rocket and missile technology. The government cited several cases in which the company made this assertion publicly and listed citizenship as a requirement in job postings, even though “export control laws impose no such hiring restrictions.”“Our investigation found that SpaceX failed to fairly consider or hire asylees and refugees because of their citizenship status and imposed what amounted to a ban on their hire regardless of their qualification, in violation of federal law,” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. “Our investigation also found that SpaceX recruiters and high-level officials took actions that actively discouraged asylees and refugees from seeking work opportunities at the company.”SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. SpaceX officials have for years asserted in interviews that its hiring practices were dictated by the requirements of a federal law known as the International Traffic in Arms Regulation.Like many rocket companies, SpaceX takes ITAR seriously. It closely guards access to its manufacturing facilities and limits what outside photographers and videographers can shoot for fear of sensitive designs being made public.The work SpaceX and other space companies do is so sensitive that recently the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, the FBI and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations issued a joint bulletin about foreign intelligence threats to the U.S. space industry.In the bulletin, the agencies said foreign intelligence entities “recognize the importance of the commercial space industry to the U.S. economy and national security, including the growing dependence of critical infrastructure on space-based assets. They see U.S. space related innovation and assets as potential threats as well as valuable opportunities to acquire vital technologies and expertise.”As a result, adversaries are using “cyberattacks, strategic investments (including joint ventures and acquisitions), targeting of key supply chain nodes, and other techniques to access and exploit the U.S. space industry.”But the bulletin said nothing about hiring as a potential concern.The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, an industry group to which SpaceX belongs, wouldn’t comment on the lawsuit. But in a statement, it noted that its members take the requirements of ITAR seriously. “ITAR applies to everything AIAA does and the Institute carefully assures we operate within the ITAR requirements,” the statement said.In its suit, the Justice Department said it opened its investigation in 2020 “and found reasonable cause to believe that SpaceX had engaged in a pattern or practice of unfair immigration-related employment practices.”In one instance, the lawsuit says, Musk, SpaceX’s founder and chief executive, posted on Twitter in 2020 that “U.S. law requires at least a green card to be hired at SpaceX, as rockets are advanced weapons technology.” Investigators also found at least 14 public announcements “stating that SpaceX can only hire U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents” because of the International Traffic in Arms Regulation, the lawsuit alleges.The lawsuit says that, according to SpaceX data, the company hired only one person out of more than 10,000 hires “who was an asylee and identified as such in his application.” SpaceX made that hire, the lawsuit asserts, about four months after the Immigrant and Employee Rights Section at the Justice Department had notified the company of its investigation. The lawsuit notes that SpaceX hires for “a wide variety of positions” including “welders, cooks, crane operators, information technology specialists, software engineers, dishwashers, business analysts, rocket engineers, marketing professionals, baristas, and more.”SpaceX in recent years has become one of the top suppliers for NASA and the Pentagon and a trusted partner to launch American astronauts to the International Space Station, as well as sensitive national security satellites. SpaceX is scheduled to launch its seventh crew rotation mission to the station Friday morning. The Pentagon has also awarded SpaceX a contract to operate its Starlink internet satellite network in Ukraine, where it has been a key communications tool for the Ukrainian military.Clarke said the Justice Department intends to “hold SpaceX accountable for its illegal employment practices and seek relief that allows asylees and refugees to fairly compete for job opportunities and contribute their talents to SpaceX’s workforce.” Clarke added that “asylees and refugees have overcome many obstacles in their lives, and unlawful employment discrimination based on their citizenship status should not be one of them.”The lawsuit seeks an order for SpaceX to hire qualified applicants it wrongly said were ineligible and to pay “an appropriate civil penalty as determined by the Administrative Law Judge for each individual discriminated against.” Over the years, the company, based in Hawthorne, Calif., has grown rapidly and has about 11,000 employees at locations in California, Florida, Texas, Washington state and the District of Columbia.This is not the first time a Musk company has faced bias accusations. Tesla, the electric vehicle manufacturer Musk leads, for years has battled lawsuits alleging workplace discrimination against its Black employees, including one filed by California’s state workplace regulator last year. In April, a judge ordered the company to pay a Black ex-worker more than $3 million. And in June, about 240 Black Tesla workers filed for class-action status in a case alleging rampant racism at the Fremont, Calif., factory.Tesla also has faced lawsuits alleging sexual harassment, and former Twitter employees filed a suit this month alleging that Musk’s layoffs discriminated based on gender, race and age.

{"id": 46, "Title": "India’s lunar landing leaves a nation enthralled and briefly unified", "Description": "NEW DELHI — As its lander approached the moon’s surface on Wednesday and its moment of history drew near, the Indian Space Research Organization switched its online telecast to split-screen mode.One half of the screen showed ISRO engineers and officials waiting anxiously in the mission control room. The other half showed Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was watching over video link.Minutes after 6 p.m. India time, the Chandrayaan-3 module touched down, and both halves of the screen burst into celebration.For India, the landing on the moon’s south pole heralded its arrival as a modern scientific power that is outshining some traditional space-faring nations, such as Russia. For Modi, a staunch nationalist who often yokes his image to grand symbols of India’s growing stature, the landing represented a personal triumph.Whatever India’s domestic challenges — a gaping lack of jobs, fitful progress in expanding manufacturing and infrastructure, rising authoritarianism and internal strife — that split-screen moment underscored how the world’s most populous nation, and Modi, are increasingly enjoying the limelight on the world’s center stage.“This moment is the announcement of an advanced India,” Modi said in an address that began immediately after ISRO officials declared the landing complete. The feat, Modi said, reflected his nation’s “Amrit Kaal,” a term from Vedic astrology meaning “auspicious period” that he often uses to describe India’s resurgence under his tenure.As the spacecraft approached the moon, India seemed to be briefly unified by a national obsession rivaling cricket.Newspapers carried photos of Hindus performing fire rituals and Muslims praying for a smooth landing. In northern Uttar Pradesh state, the conservative chief minister Yogi Adityanath ordered all schools to broadcast the ISRO live, while a hip restaurant chain in southern Bangalore hosted watch parties.To be sure, Indian and foreign space industry experts say the landing has many practical benefits for Indian science and its space program.India lands a spacecraft softly on the moon’s surfaceBy being the first country to deploy a rover on the south pole, India could bring back new data about pools of water that NASA scientists believe are frozen in craters and could one day be used to sustain a  crewed lunar base. Indian scientists say ISRO will gain precious experience from the landing — its previous attempt in 2019 failed in a crash — and also earn a say in future space-related international discussions.“India’s space power is related to soft power,” said Ajey Lele, a space expert at the Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses, a think tank funded by the Defense Ministry. “There’s a lot of attraction to India right now. Americans, Japan … people are keen to collaborate.”But the landing was also symbolically significant for India and its prime minister, one of the space program’s biggest cheerleaders.Only four countries have landed on the moon. One of them, Russia, sought to make a return earlier this week, but the Luna-25 lander crashed on Monday. Earlier this year, a similar mission by a Japanese company failed.Wednesday was a reminder that “India knows how to do more with less. The Russians and Japanese showed this is not easy,” said Mike Gold, a former NASA associate administrator who worked with India this year to sign the Artemis Accords, a set of principles guiding conduct in space.Gold described India as an increasingly key player in the international space industry in recent years, particularly after the Modi government changed rules in 2020 to allow private start-ups to enter the sector and provide them with subsidies for new facilities. Indian officials promised this summer they are in the final stages of formulating a policy that would open India’s private space sector to foreign direct investment. ISRO’s director has spelled out ambitions for India to claim about 8 percent of the global space industry, up from 2 percent today.“The second golden age of space, driven by private players — we’re seeing that occur in India like we did a decade or two ago in the U.S.,” said Gold, who is now an executive at Redwire Space, a private company in Jacksonville, Fla.While Modi has placed himself in a central role in international politics — he has been courted by both the United States and Russia over the Ukraine war and has presented himself as a potential peacemaker — India’s space industry is also seeing interest from many countries, partly due to economics, and partly due to politics.For decades, ISRO has quietly been one of the most cost-effective providers of rocket launches. Between 2018 and 2022, ISRO launched 177 satellites for other countries, the science minister said in Parliament in November. In March, ISRO rockets lofted 36 satellites for the satellite internet provider OneWeb after sanctions resulting from the Ukraine war meant the London-based company could no longer use Russian Soyuz rockets to ferry its cargo.India, which has sent astronauts for training in Russia ahead of its first human spaceflight mission in the coming two years, also signed a deal in January with the Biden administration to train astronauts in Houston.And much of this progress has been pushed by Modi himself, who in a 2018 Independence Day speech pledged to send an Indian astronaut to space. Modi drew ridicule from critics who noted that he has had mixed results fulfilling more basic promises such as building toilets in every village household or improving women’s health. But since then, the Indian leader has doubled down and announced new plans to explore the deep sea with submersibles that can descend 6,000 meters.“Space and space exploration has always evoked a lot of interest in Prime Minister Modi personally,” said Ashok Malik, a former government adviser who is now a partner at the Asia Group consultancy. Malik recalled Modi, 72, often professing his admiration for Neil Armstrong landing on the moon — a moment that many Indians of his generation recall vividly.“He has often spoken about July 20, 1969, and what that day really meant for him,” Malik said.When faced with criticism that India wasted money in space, Modi has previously countered that India specialized in “frugal engineering” and a lunar mission cost less than the $100 million Hollywood spent to make the 2013 space film “Gravity.” ISRO officials said the cost of the entire Chandrayaan-3 mission was about $77 million.Siri Hulikal, a fiction writer in Bangalore, said she took her 8-year-old son, Achintya, to the local Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium to watch the landing even though he had a crucial Hindi exam the following morning.“I said, ‘Chuck it, the Chandrayaan-3 isn’t going to happen again,’” Hulikal said.When she arrived 45 minutes before the scheduled touchdown, the viewing area outside the planetarium was already packed. Kids had their faces painted with the Indian flag. Seniors sat in the audience to hear a retired ISRO scientist explain in layman’s terms what exactly the landing entailed.Just before 6 p.m., Hulikal said, the noise in the crowd began to build. The retired ISRO scientist’s presentation was completely drowned out as the lander touched down. Achintya jumped into the air and hugged his mother.“It was electric,” Hulikal said. “All you could hear was ‘Jai Hind’” — Long live India.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/08/24/india-moon-lunar-landing-modi/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 24, 2023 at 1:41 p.m. EDT", "Tag": "Technology", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 47, "Title": "These are some of the notable companies laying off workers", "Description": "The U.S. job market has been remarkably strong, even in the face of other economic head winds. More than a year into the Federal Reserve’s campaign to cool the economy, the United States added 187,000 jobs in July, bringing the unemployment rate to 3.5 percent.Yet there’s been a proliferation of large-scale layoffs this year. Some of the deepest cuts have occurred in the tech and media sectors: Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, HP, and the parent companies of Google and Facebook have all signaled plans to slash several thousand workers. After initially cutting thousands of workers, Amazon and Facebook just a few months later announced plans to lay off thousands more.Deeply, truly, very sorry: How tech CEOs talk when they lay off workersCompanies in other industries also are cutting back, including Goldman Sachs, Ford, 3M, Hasbro, Boeing, Disney, Tyson and CVS Health.Though prices have eased, inflation remains elevated and an ongoing headache for the Federal Reserve, which has been aggressively raising interest rates to combat it. In March, it also had to contend with turmoil in the banking sector that some observers say will weigh on bank lending and tighten credit conditions.Technology firms and Wall Street banks, which belong to sectors more sensitive to rising borrowing costs, have generated some of the most notable layoff announcements.Aaron Terrazas, chief economist at the employment website Glassdoor, said three kinds of companies are cutting staff: those for whom debt is becoming more expensive amid the Fed’s tightening; those uncertain about the economic outlook; and those using the economic climate as an excuse to cut employees they would have let go anyway.“The biggest question right now is this reevaluation of risk,” Terrazas said, noting that businesses coming out of the pandemic must contend with geopolitics, employee retention, investment and the supply chain.“Today’s business leaders have been scarred by this endless parade of risk events over the past couple of years and just desperately want a year when things go according to plan — and so they’re planning conservatively,” he said. “That’s the dynamic that we’re seeing in the economy.”Here’s a rundown of some of the more significant layoffs:Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is cutting about 12,000 jobs, CEO Sundar Pichai said in January. He said that the job cuts — estimated to be 6 percent of the workforce — will occur across the company and that the decision came after a “rigorous review.” Alphabet nodded to the tremendous growth the company experienced over the past two years, but demand has waned with the return to in-person life and with interest rate increases, which have made borrowing more expensive. Pichai said that the company had hired to meet the prior surge but that the economic reality the company faces now is far different.Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is cutting about 12,000 jobs, CEO Sundar Pichai said in January.

In March, Amazon said it planed to lay off an additional 9,000 workers, citing an “uncertain economy.” The reduction appears to be the largest in a decade of near-constant expansion, with more than 1.5 million employees at the end of September. Amazon, like other tech companies, went on a hiring binge during the pandemic, and analysts say the layoffs mark the end of an era marked by industry bloat.

The cuts underscored a tumultuous new period in Silicon Valley, whose tech giants have been long regarded as recession-proof. Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s founder, has said declines in online shopping and advertising competition led to a decline in revenue. His company has also bet big on a push to create a virtual world often called the metaverse.

Salesforce has more than 79,000 employees, meaning the layoffs could affect nearly 8,000 people. Co-chief executive Marc Benioff said the company hired too many people when its sales surged during the pandemic.

{"id": 48, "Title": "India lands a spacecraft softly on the moon’s surface", "Description": "India landed a robotic spacecraft on the moon Wednesday, a feat that came just days after a Russian vehicle crashed into the surface after firing its thrusters for too long.India’s spacecraft, without any astronauts on board, landed at about 8:30 a.m. Eastern time near the moon’s south pole, an area that several nations covet because it contains water in the form of ice in permanently shadowed craters.Shortly after the lander touched down, the Indian space agency released a photo of the lunar surface taken from the craft but did not provide details about the health of the vehicle. Late Wednesday, it reported that the rover the spacecraft had been carrying had deployed. “India took a walk on the moon!” the space agency posted on social media. It added Thursday morning that, “all activities are on schedule. All systems are normal.” Plans call for the rover to operate for about 14 days to study the composition of the moon’s soil and rocks.The successful touchdown of the Chandrayaan-3 mission was a triumph for a country with growing ambitions in space and was cheered across the nation of more than 1 billion people. India became the fourth country to land successfully on the moon, after the United States, the Soviet Union and China, and it became the first to touch down near the south pole. In 2019, a similar mission failed at the last minute because of a software issue. But the mission did successfully put a spacecraft in orbit around the moon that has been mapping the lunar surface in the years since.“India is on the moon,” declared Sreedhara Somanath, head of the India Space Research Organization, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi watched while waving an Indian flag.Speaking by video link from South Africa, where he is attending a summit of the  BRICS nations, Modi told cheering staffers and reporters at ISRO headquarters that India was entering a historically auspicious moment. “My dear family, when we see history being made in front of us, it makes our life blessed,” he said. “This moment is the announcement of an advanced India. These moments are of invention and phenomenal growth. … We had taken a pledge on Earth and realized it on the moon.”“This success belongs to all of humanity and it will help more missions by other countries in the future,” Modi added.The mission is one of several destined for the lunar surface. Japan is scheduled to launch a small spacecraft to the moon later this week to test its ability to land precisely, a capability that would benefit future missions. And later this year, two private American companies, working under contract with NASA, are also scheduled to fly robotic spacecraft to the lunar surface as part of the space agency’s Artemis program.Chandrayaan-3 Mission: The image captured by the Landing Imager Camera after the landing. It shows a portion of Chandrayaan-3's landing site. Seen also is a leg and its accompanying shadow. Chandrayaan-3 chose a relatively flat region on the lunar surface 🙂… pic.twitter.com/xi7RVz5UvWUltimately, NASA intends to return humans to the moon for the first time since the last of the Apollo missions in 1972. The goal this time is to establish an enduring presence on and around the moon and to use the resources of the moon to help sustain human life. NASA also intends to assemble a small space station, called Gateway, around the moon to support the effort.Modi has sought to bolster the India’s space agency as a symbol of the country’s stature on the global stage. Its space program is being used as a way to boost its economy and growing tech sector, analysts say. It has also sought to keep up with China, which has big ambitions in space and has already landed on the moon. India has also flexed its military space capabilities; in 2019, it hit a satellite with a missile, demonstrating its ability to target adversaries’ space assets.Unlike rivals such as China and Russia, India has aligned itself with the United States by signing an agreement on space exploration, known as the Artemis Accords, a legal framework that governs activity in space. So far, nearly 30 countries have signed, allowing them to partner with the United States on space missions and mandating that they adhere to a set of rules, such as publicly sharing scientific discoveries and creating “safety zones” where nations could work undisturbed on the lunar surface.In an interview after the landing, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson called it “a significant accomplishment,” and said that “we congratulate them and we consider them our partner.”During a signing ceremony in June, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, India’s ambassador to the United States, said: “India is a responsible space power and places the highest importance on the peaceful and sustainable use of outer space. We are confident that the Artemis Accords will advance a rule-based approach to outer space.”After the failed landing effort in 2019, Modi vowed the country would not give up. “We came very close,” he said. “Our determination to touch the moon has become even stronger.”The United States has also cast itself in a space race with China, which has plans to send astronauts to the moon by 2030. NASA has scheduled its first human landing, known as the Artemis III mission, for 2025, but recently NASA officials have said it would likely slip into 2026. If the schedule continues to slip, Jim Free, NASA’s associate administrator for the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, said earlier this month that NASA could “end up flying a different mission.”That might mean a trip around the moon without a landing, but he did not offer specifics. Nelson said in the interview that, “NASA, as always, looks at all contingencies. But the plan is Artemis III is going to land.”Congress has been supportive of the Artemis program, protecting funding for the missions even as it cut other parts of the agency’s budget. A competition with China could spur some to push NASA to move fast and help ensure it has adequate funding.NASA is still on track to launch four astronauts on a mission around the moon by the end of 2024. That mission, known as Artemis II, followed a successful flight of the Orion spacecraft, without any people on board, around the moon last year.The possibility that water can be found near the lunar south pole has intrigued space agencies and scientists around the world who are eager to harvest it. Water obviously is vital for human survival and would be an important component for any lunar settlement. But broken into its component parts, hydrogen and oxygen, it could also be used as rocket fuel.Nelson said he was not concerned that India got to the south pole before the United States. “Space is international, and NASA has embraced that with gusto,” he said. “That’s why we go back to the moon with an international mission.”Engineers at ISRO worked to make a more robust design for the Chandrayaan-3 flight. It launched on July 14 and flew to lunar orbit without any trouble.“The mission is on schedule,” the agency tweeted on Tuesday. “Systems are undergoing regular checks. Smooth sailing is continuing.”Gerry Shih contributed to this report.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/23/chandrayaan-3-india-moon-landing/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 23, 2023 at 8:37 a.m. EDT", "Tag": "Technology", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 49, "Title": "AI is so hot even KFC and Williams-Sonoma execs are talking about it", "Description": "America’s public companies are embracing artificial intelligence fever.More than 1,000 companies mentioned the technology in their quarterly reports this summer, up from just 36 a decade ago, according to a Washington Post analysis.More and more companies Tech executives and analysts have trumpeted AI as the next big technological revolution, comparing it with the advent of electricity or the internet. The hype has gripped politicians, who are scrambling to come up with new AI-focused regulations, and the amount of venture capital money pouring into companies claiming to have AI tech is ballooning.On Wednesday, chip company Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings thanks to the boom in AI, sending its shares shooting up.At the same time, there are signs the boom is actually slowing, with the number of people using “generative” AI tools like ChatGPT actually beginning to fall in recent months, and venture capitalists beginning to warn entrepreneurs that the path to building a profitable AI start-up is complicated and expensive.Still, that’s not stopping America’s corporate executives from obsessing over the tech. Ulta Beauty in its annual report said it used AI in part to power its “virtual try-on and skin analysis tools.” Fidelity cited the technology as part of its tool kit to detect fraud. Alaska Air used it to “enable more fuel-efficient flight paths.” Medical company Hologic’s AI algorithm helps medical practicians identify precancerous lesions and cervical cancer cells in women. Yum China Holdings, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, plans to use AI to better connect online orders to brick and mortar stores.The technology has become what AI pioneer Marvin Minsky referred to as a “suitcase term, ” said Joseph Fuller, a Harvard Business School professor. “You kind of jam anything in there you wanted, you know, and carry it around and say ‘Oh, this is my AI.’”Companies are even adding AI to their name. In 2019 C3 IoT — shorthand for the buzzword of yesteryear, the internet of things — rebranded to C3 AI. According to the company, the name change was to better meet market perceptions and came with a suite of new products.Roughly one in seven public companies talked up AI in their most recent annual filings, following a boom in generative AI, which create text or images based on prompts, pushed it into the mainstream. This year, the stock market has rallied, largely driven by companies that are at the center of the AI revolution like Microsoft and Nvidia.It’s become such a buzzword that some companies were “starting to rebrand things they were already doing as artificial intelligence,” said Mark Riedl, a professor who focuses on artificial intelligence at Georgia Tech. Nearly anything involving data could be considered AI. “And you might just get a little bit of extra pop for whatever you’re trying to achieve.”AI technology goes well beyond the generative tools like ChatGPT or the Dall-E image generator. The term can describe a wide range of technology, including using data to spot patterns and make predictions. This is the type of AI most widely used by companies today, said Fuller.The latest technology breakthroughs are so recent that CEOs “will be learning about it too, but they’ll want to reassure institutional retail investors that they’re not asleep at the switch.”It’s not all upside. Advances in AI are reported as an intellectual property risk in Williams-Sonoma’s annual report. Shoe Carnival states a risk in being “unable to quickly adapt to rapid change” brought on by AI and other technologies. Many more companies, such as Adobe and Zoom, note that regulation of AI could disrupt their business model.While business services and manufacturing, which both include technology companies, make up the bulk of companies touting AI to investors, in recent years more financial firms — and especially blank check companies — have joined the ranks.Blank check companies, also known as special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), raise money from investors to merge with and take private companies public. They previously latched on to financial crazes in cannabis, crypto and electric vehicles (EV).Some deals went spectacularly bust. Several EV companies that went public with SPACs, such Lordstown and Nikola, now trade 90 percent below their peak. Most have share prices less than half of their peak, according to The Post analysis of EV and EV-related companies that went public with SPACs in 2020 and 2021, identified by consulting firm Frost and Sullivan.“Most SPACs are just everyday, ordinary companies,” said Stanford law professor Michael Klausner. “But they’re disproportionately … fad-like companies.”It may be too soon to tell, however, how much of the AI hype is just that.“There’s a lot of exuberance, a lot of excitement with regard to the role AI will play in the economy going forward,” said StoneX chief market strategist Kathryn Rooney Vera. “Everybody wants to be in the space or they talk about being in the space.”Gerrit De Vynck contributed to this report.The Post analyzed references to “artificial intelligence” in 10-K forms filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) using the agency’s Edgar search tool and index files.

{"id": 50, "Title": "As fires and floods rage, Facebook and Twitter are missing in action", "Description": "As wildfires ravage western Canada, Canadians can’t read the news about them on Facebook or Instagram. This month, Facebook parent company Meta blocked links to news organizations on its major social networks in Canada to protest a law that would require it to pay publishers for distributing their content.As a freak tropical storm flooded swaths of Southern California over the weekend, residents and government agencies who turned to X, formerly known as Twitter, for real-time updates struggled to discern fact from fiction. That has gotten far more difficult, officials say, since Elon Musk jumbled the site’s verification policies, removing the blue check marks from verified journalists and media outlets — instead granting them to anyone who pays a monthly fee.Facebook and Twitter spent years making themselves essential conduits for news. Now that government agencies, the media and hundreds of millions of people have come to rely on them for critical information in times of crisis, the social media giants have decided they’re not so invested in the news after all.Tech titans Mark Zuckerberg and Musk may not agree on much. But both have pulled back, in different ways, from what their companies once saw as a responsibility, to both their users and society, to connect people with reliable sources of information. A drumbeat of natural disasters, probably intensified by climate change, is highlighting the consequences of that retrenchment.“Just a few years ago, Twitter was a really valuable way for us to communicate with the public,” said Brian Ferguson, deputy director of crisis communications for California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. “It’s much more challenging now because of some of the changes that have happened.”On Monday, after Tropical Storm Hilary soaked Los Angeles and inundated Palm Springs, Calif., Ferguson said his agency “spent a good portion of the day as part of our emergency response combating mis- and disinformation.” Widely shared posts on X showed doctored images of Los Angeles landmarks underwater and claimed the Federal Emergency Management Agency was out of money and unable to respond — none of which was true, he said.In photos: Tropical Storm Hilary unleashes flooding and mudslides in CaliforniaSuch hoaxes have been common on social media for years. But Twitter pre-Musk had been stepping up efforts to moderate misinformation, including hiding posts that featured misleading claims and employing a team of journalists to fact-check viral trends. The site also highlighted breaking news stories from accounts and media outlets it deemed reliable. The moves were in keeping with the pride Twitter had long taken in its role as a global hub for real-time information during emergencies, dating back to the 2010 Haiti earthquake and 2011 Fukushima disaster.Under Musk, however, X has scaled back its misinformation policies, reinstated banned accounts, laid off content moderators, disbanded the teams responsible for fact-checking its trending topics and turned hostile to the mainstream media. A Washington Post analysis last week found that X appeared to be throttling links to several major media and social media sites specifically disfavored by Musk, including Reuters and the New York Times.Ferguson said X also seems to have cut the staff who once liaised with his office and other local governments, so public agencies no longer have a point of contact should they get hacked, impersonated or locked out of their accounts during an emergency. He added that changes to the company’s data access policies have driven away widely followed accounts that tracked fires and earthquakes.Musk’s changes have had other unforeseen impacts. Missouri officials were dismayed to find last month that new restrictions on people’s ability to view posts without being logged in left residents unable to access links in the state’s AMBER Alerts.X did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.While Musk’s beef with the media has been widely documented, Meta has been distancing itself from the news more quietly and gradually — at least until recently.A decade ago, CEO Zuckerberg declared his intention to turn Facebook into the world’s “best personalized newspaper.” Two years later, fighting a tide of spam and clickbait in users’ feeds, the company voluntarily paid media outlets — including The Post — to deliver some of their best content to readers directly on the platform. In the wake of the 2016 election, Facebook hired huge teams of moderators to police the site for misinformation and implemented changes to its algorithm aimed at prioritizing trustworthy news sources.But relations between Facebook and the media deteriorated amid ongoing scrutiny of its moderation policies and its effect on the news industry. By 2018, the company was making changes to send less traffic to news publishers, and in 2021, it began downgrading political content. When Meta launched its Twitter rival Threads in July, Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri said from the outset that news and politics would not be a priority.It’s no surprise then that the company has balked at recent efforts by countries, including Australia and Canada, to make it pay news publishers for excerpting or linking to their articles. While Facebook struck an 11th-hour deal in 2021 to keep news on its platform in Australia, Meta has declined to negotiate with publishers in Canada after that country passed its online news act in June, opting instead to permanently remove news from Facebook and Instagram starting Aug. 1.“The truth is, our users don’t come to us for news,” Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, wrote in May. He noted that links to news stories were already less than 3 percent of what users saw in their Facebook feeds.But the wildfires have underscored the news ban’s impacts as people in the Northwest Territories accustomed to getting their news from Facebook have found it bereft of vital information. On Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined calls from a slew of other government officials for Meta to lift the ban, slamming the company for putting “corporate profits” above the public interest.In a statement Monday, Meta spokesman Andy Stone blamed the Canadian law’s “broad scope,” while noting that people in Canada can still use Facebook and Instagram to “connect with loved ones,” mark themselves as “safe” from the fires and access official government information, including crisis response pages.In the long run, there could be silver linings in Meta’s and X’s retreats from a dominant role in the online news economy. People might relearn how to seek out more trustworthy — if less convenient — information sources. Public agencies might also refocus their energies on cultivating direct lines to residents, rather than relying on social media.But in the meantime, Musk’s and Zuckerberg’s relinquishment of what they once saw as responsibilities leaves a more fractured, fragmented public square: The news industry they disrupted has shrunk dramatically, and trust in media has plummeted as outlets shifted their coverage to cater to social media algorithms that reward sensationalism. Rival social networks such as TikTok raise their own accountability and credibility concerns.“This is not just limited to social media,” California’s Ferguson said. “The lack of trust in media writ large has also changed the way we communicate with the public,” because “people are more dubious of the information they receive online.” He added: “I worry about it every day.”", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/24/canada-fires-ca-floods-meta-x-news/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 24, 2023 at 6:00 a.m. EDT", "Tag": "Technology", "Keywords": "Wildfires, Facebook, Twitter."}
{"id": 51, "Title": "Folding phones are suddenly everywhere. Are they any good?", "Description": "Your phone can take award-winning photos, play any song ever recorded and connect you to the sum of human knowledge. But can it fold in half?The answer is probably no, but your next phone might.Global sales of foldable smartphones are expected to grow by more than 50 percent this year, research firm International Data Corporation estimates, as Motorola, Google and Samsung are all keen to sell you on their latest models. But what does living with a foldable really get you?To find out, we tested all the new folding phones these companies have released so far this year — and there’s at least one more still on the way — to get a better sense of what’s good and what isn’t.If you’re thinking of upgrading to a foldable smartphone, here’s what you need to know.Flip-style foldables will probably feel familiar to anyone who had a cellphone in the early 2000s. They’re pretty traditional smartphones when open, but you can flip them shut when you’re done. This includes Samsung’s new Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Motorola’s 2023 Razr+.The main draw? Portability. You can more easily cram them into a pocket or a small bag, and newer models sweeten the deal with features like large, external screens. That means you can use them to frame up selfies with the phone’s main cameras, quickly control your music and respond to messages without having to open the phone.Your other option is a much bigger kind of foldable that looks like a regular smartphone when closed, but transforms into a small tablet upon opening. You’ll often see them with names that include the word “fold,” and these gadgets are often called “hybrids” because they’re effectively two gadgets in one.These devices can feel pretty unwieldy compared with traditional phones, but their large inner screens make them ideal for diving into movies, books and games. They’re also great for multitasking — you’ll be able use at least two apps side by side, and in some cases, you can have up to four apps open at once. That’s obviously not something everyone needs to do, but foldables can definitely be helpful if you frequently find yourself juggling lots of tasks.Expect to see sticker prices that are generally a little higher than normal. That’s especially true of those phone-tablet hybrids — they have been around for nearly four years, but none of the companies that sell them in the United States has ever released a new model that costs less than $1,700.The story is a little different for flip-style foldables — they can now be had for around $1,000 brand new, which is still a lot of money for a phone, but well within the realm of the price of high-end smartphones these days. (Premium phones like Samsung’s Galaxy S23 Ultra and Apple’s iPhone 14 Pro actually cost more.)Our usual advice applies here: When you feel it’s time to get a new phone, do everything you can to avoid paying full price. It generally doesn’t take much work — at most, it’ll require a little patience.Should you upgrade your phone at all right now? Our quiz can help you decide.For one, battery life can be an issue for some models.Earlier devices often struggled to last through a full day, which can feel unacceptable considering how much these things cost. More recent flip-style models from both companies have batteries that last at least a bit longer, but if you spend a lot of time on your phone, you’ll probably still need to charge it again before the day is over.If you take a lot of photos, you may be disappointed to know that folding phones rarely get the latest and greatest cameras. That’s mostly because of how they’re designed — because they fold in half, there’s less room inside for the big, fancy camera sensors that tend to wind up in expensive, traditional phones.And even through current foldable phones aren’t as fragile as earlier models, you still need to be at least a little more careful handling them. They’re much worse, for example, at shrugging off dust, dirt, and debris than a traditional phone — that’s those little bits can wiggle their way inside and potentially damage the device’s screen or hinge.Wading through all your options can be tricky — here’s what we found after testing them.Google Pixel Fold ($1,799): The Pixel Fold is Google’s first attempt at a foldable, and in some ways it shows; it’s heavy even by foldable standards, and it sports chunky bezels around its inner screen. Battery life is also just fine — I had hoped for better out of such an expensive phone.What saves the Pixel Fold is the rest of its design, such as its spacious, passport-shaped screen, and my favorite camera setup of any foldable I’ve tested. We generally recommend people avoid first-generation products, and the Pixel Fold is no exception — but it gets enough right that I hope Google decides to keep making them.(If you’re interested in more, you can find our full review of the Pixel Fold here.)Samsung Galaxy Z Fold5 ($1,799): Samsung has released five of these devices in four years, so it’s no wonder the new Z Fold feels so polished. Beyond that, it uses a powerful (and up-to-date) processor, which makes it a touch more future-proof than the Pixel Fold. And its software — while finicky — offers a lot of flexibility. This is also the best foldable we’ve tested for multitasking; with a little work, you can get up to four apps running on-screen at the same time.But it’s not perfect. The barely-there bezels around the inner screen don’t offer much room for your fingers, so accidental taps are common. And the tall, narrow front screen can feel awkward to use as a phone — imagine texting on your TV’s remote control and you’re on the right track. Even so, it’s the safest — and most elegant — choice for anyone considering a phone-tablet hybrid. But don’t buy one until you’ve tried one for yourself.Motorola Razr+ ($999): Motorola took a years-long break before releasing this year’s Razr+, and that time off was well spent. The Razr is sleek and comfortable to hold, and its large outer screen lets you run nearly any app without having to open the phone. (It’s also, in my opinion, the best-looking phone of the bunch.)The catch? It sometimes struggles to get through a full day’s use without a charge, and it’s the least water resistant of all the foldables we tested. It’s a solid choice if you’re not accident-prone, but we still have some lingering questions about long-term durability.Samsung Galaxy Z Flip5 ($999): Like its larger sibling, the Z Flip5 is the safe choice for people who want a flip-style foldable. It’s a little faster than last year’s model, it’s a little more durable, and its battery lasts a little longer — though that’s mostly because I could do more without having to open (and power up) the larger inside screen.But thrilling it isn’t. It lags behind the Razr — the Z Flip5′s outer screen takes more work to set up, I find its blocky design a little less comfortable to hold. But with a longer commitment for software updates and niceties like better water resistance, it’s a great place for foldable newbies to start.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/24/foldable-phone-flip-guide-2023/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 24, 2023 at 6:00 a.m. EDT", "Tag": "Technology", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 52, "Title": "San Francisco bets on Ikea opening, cheap meatballs to liven up downtown", "Description": "SAN FRANCISCO — In a city still struggling to rebound from the pandemic, officials are pinning their hopes on an unlikely hero for the beleaguered downtown: plates of cheap Swedish meatballs.Ikea — the Swedish retail chain known for affordable furniture, an assortment of beige foods and that one time a monkey in a coat was locked inside — opened a new 52,000-square-foot store on San Francisco’s long-troubled Market Street on Wednesday. Its grand opening in the empty mall has attracted more fanfare here than the average store, with a wall of media cameras, a DJ, employees waving Swedish flags and an appearance by Mayor London Breed.“Like any major city, we know San Francisco has challenges, but we also know that people want to be here,” Breed (D) said at a Wednesday news conference. “As a result of opening Ikea here today … [the city is] showing our resiliency and our willingness to do everything it takes to bring back business to San Francisco.”Lately, the narrative around this city has been grim: hollowed-out office buildings, a vexing homelessness crisis, and big chain stores such as Nordstrom, Old Navy, Gap and Whole Foods closing amid frequent crime and dwindling foot traffic. But the arrival of the Swedish furniture giant has brought a bit of joy and optimism to the downtown corridor, which has been largely ditched by the tech employees who once defined the area.Ikea “not only creates an opportunity for people to shop, but it creates an opportunity for people to work,” Breed said. “That is important and a part of the fabric of San Francisco.”While the city’s Mid-Market neighborhood — close to the iconic Union Square and one of the city’s cable-car routes — isn’t exactly San Francisco’s most famous tourist draw (there are no sea lions, and the burritos are expensive), it’s still seen as an important indicator of the city’s overall economic health. The mall that Ikea is moving into has long been considered one of the biggest failures of the area, as city leaders and the owners struggled to attract a tenant since its construction in 2016.Officials were so desperate to fill it that, at one point, they briefly considered turning it into a homeless shelter.The pandemic was yet another major setback for the neighborhood, as office tenants abandoned their leases and another major mall defaulted on its mortgage. But now, the city is cautiously optimistic that Ikea will attract a steady stream of foot traffic from people buying cheap furniture or just looking for an affordable lunch. Ikea executives called the area a “meeting place” and said it eventually will have co-working spaces available as well.Local Maria Amunategui isn’t a fan of the meatballs but is delighted to have an Ikea closer to her home.“I usually have to go to Emeryville, and it’s 23 minutes away,” she said. On Wednesday, she came to return something she bought at a different location, not expecting a wall of cheering employees, cameras and balloons. “It’s a surprise!” she added.City officials have been desperate to get people back downtown, where office vacancy rates have remained stubbornly high since the pandemic. Breed recently passed a tax break to lure companies to sign new leases downtown, though it’s still too early to tell whether that will make a notable difference. Officials here are also trying to capitalize on the current frenzy of activity in the AI industry, with hopes that it could usher in another tech boom for San Francisco.The mayor even went as far as to recently declare San Francisco the “AI capital of the world.”At least for a day, the Ikea did lure more people to the neighborhood and improve the overall mood. After the mayor cut a giant purple ribbon that said “Ikea San Francisco,” employees greeted customers one at a time from a line that stretched to the end of the block. Shoppers danced into the store as Kool & the Gang’s “Celebration” blasted through speakers, many stopping to pull on complimentary Ikea T-shirts and blue bucket hats. Nearby, San Francisco Supervisor Matt Dorsey danced and waved a tiny Swedish flag.San Francisco’s smaller Ikea is designed more for a city center than its larger suburban hubs, which can be triple the size. The new Ikea sells basics you can carry out but doesn’t stock bulkier items such as sofas, though it will let customers buy them for delivery. It has the usual showrooms made up to look like real city apartments, cramped layouts and all. There’s a Swedish food court with all of the Ikea classics, including meatballs and vegetable balls, lox, pickled things, and poached salmon. The company said it specifically added more vegetarian and sustainable options — things San Franciscans are known to enjoy.Agnes Caballero “was just curious” about the new store and came to do a little reconnaissance Wednesday. Weaving between aisles of bedding accessories, she said she was looking for a cabinet for her house but would have to wait for her husband to buy anything because he had the measurements.The store also has its own teams of security guards in place to handle potential shoplifting — a common problem for the area, which has long struggled with homelessness and visible drug use.San Francisco’s mayor told reporters Wednesday that the “area has always been a tad bit of a challenge.” Breed added, “We hope that with a lot of the people who are in this area, that many of them are being offered chances to work for Ikea and other businesses.”Nothing comes to this part of downtown these days without its host of challenges.In 2011, San Francisco lured a number of tech companies — including X, formerly known as Twitter — to the rough patch of downtown in exchange for a tax break. The hope was that the companies and their well-paid employees would revitalize the area, as they spend their big paychecks at the cafes, restaurants and bars before and after work. But that dream never came to fruition, in part because the city didn’t anticipate the tech industry’s cushy culture of providing food and drink perks inside the offices.Then a Whole Foods opened in 2022 with similar hopes of luring more foot traffic to the area. But it closed just a year later, after struggling with frequent shoplifting, drug use in and around the store, and at least one fatal overdose in the bathroom.The hype around Ikea is counter to San Francisco’s mom-and-pop culture, which often chafes at any big corporate chains opening up shop. In many neighborhoods here, any corporation with multiple other locations worldwide must get special permission from City Hall to open. But downtown doesn’t have the same legislative hang-ups, which meant Ikea could open here without going through a gantlet of approvals.On Wednesday, the first customers were welcomed by cheering employees wearing blue and yellow shirts that said “Hej!” Each person was handed one of Ikea’s signature blue bags filled with swag, including an Ikea bucket hat, shirt and watering can.“I think it will bring more people downtown,” said Ruby Tsang, a recent San Francisco transplant who rents a studio apartment nearby. She plans to shop at the location for furniture for her small space and stop in at other times, too. “It’s great if I want to meet someone for coffee or lunch.”", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/23/ikea-san-francisco-downtown/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 23, 2023 at 2:19 p.m. EDT", "Tag": "Technology", "Keywords": "Ikea, Market Street, San Francisco."}

The jump comes after the company’s shares already tripled this year, making Nvidia the world’s sixth-most valuable public company, behind only Big Tech stalwarts and Saudi Arabia’s state oil producer.Nvidia has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the wave of interest in “generative” AI tools spurred by the launch of OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT last November. Nvidia’s computer chips are specially suited to help AI programs crunch the huge amounts of data necessary to give them the capability to have complex conversations, translate language and generate images based on simple prompts. Though there are signs that interest from consumers in chatbots is waning, large companies are busy buying as many of Nvidia’s chips as they can to give themselves the ability to train and run AI software of their own.The interest in AI is “beginning to drive substantial demand in the real world, and Nvidia is perfectly poised to keep benefiting from that trend,” said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at financial news and analysis company Investing.com. “The main message here is that a huge number of big companies worldwide are actually willing to bet their futures on AI, and they will have to do so with Nvidia chips if they don’t want to fall behind the competition.”Nvidia reported revenue of $13.5 billion, compared the $11.2 billion than analysts had expected, on average, according to data company FactSet. Next quarter, Nvidia said it expects its revenue to be even higher, at around $16 billion.“A new computing era has begun.

Here’s how to apply.", "Description": "Five years after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, millions of Facebook users may be able to get money back from the social media company for their troubles.Facebook, which is owned by Meta, reached a $725 million class-action settlement earlier this year over claims it shared users’ data without their consent. Millions of people can fill out a claim form to get a slice of the settlement amount, but only if they apply before the deadline this Friday, Aug. 25.If you are a current or former Facebook user, here’s how to get started.Anyone who used Facebook between May 24, 2007, and Dec. 22, 2022, can submit a claim, even if you no longer have a Facebook account. Political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica was accused of improperly using a quiz app on the social media site to access the personal data of 87 million Facebook users without their consent.You have to submit a claim to get any money. If you don’t submit one, you won’t get a payment. You also will not be able to sue Facebook on your own for the same privacy violation, if that was something you were considering.To start the process, you’ll fill out a simple form. You can mail in a printed version or do it online at facebookuserprivacysettlement.com. If you are a current Facebook user, you should also have received an alert in the app or site that links to the settlement page and instructions.You’ll need some key information, including your email address, phone number or username or user ID to confirm your account. The form also asks you to share payment information so you can receive the payout. If you no longer have your account, you can note the years it was active to the best of your recollection. You may be able to find your old sign-up and cancellation emails to find the right dates.If you’ve had multiple Facebook accounts over the years, you can file a claim for only one of them. Use whichever you had open the longest.You have until this Friday, Aug. 25, 2023, 11:59 p.m. Pacific time.There’s no set payout amount per user, but don’t expect a windfall. The final checks will depend on a number of factors, including how many people fill out a claim form.The biggest payout from the settlement will go to legal fees for the lawyers behind it. They can claim up to 25 percent of the $725 million, or a little over $180 million. There are eight named plaintiffs in the case, and they could receive up to $15,000 each. The rest of the pool will be divided up between affected Facebook users who filed claims.While it’s unlikely to result in a big payday for Facebook users, it’s still smart to file a claim. In addition to getting enough for at least a couple lattes, these settlements can send a message to the companies.“Even when it’s a relatively low dollar amount, one of the other main purposes of consumer class actions isn’t compensation, its deterrence,” says Adam Zimmerman, a professor of law at USC Gould School of Law, who specializes in class actions. “Yes, 80 million people might not even really care to recover their small amounts, but we don’t want to create a procedural system where a company can do that over and over to consumers.”Don’t make any big plans for your money yet. The final hearing to approve the settlement doesn’t happen until September. Even if approved, there could be bureaucratic and legal delays such as appeals. If it is approved, it could take at least 90 more days for the payment process to start, says Zimmerman.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/23/facebook-settlement-claim-deadline/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 23, 2023 at 6:00 a.m. EDT", "Tag": "Technology", "Keywords": "Keywords: Facebook, settlement, Cambridge Analytica scandal."}
{"id": 55, "Title": "What to know about India’s Chandrayaan-3 moon landing", "Description": "This week was shaping up to be a split-screen race between Russia and India to become the first nation to land on the moon’s south pole. But after Russia’s Luna-25 spacecraft crashed, all eyes were on India  Wednesday to see whether its second attempt at a lunar landing was successful.The success of the Chandrayaan-3 mission made India the fourth nation to land on the surface of the moon.Chandrayaan-3, which means “moon vehicle” in Hindi and Sanskrit, launched from the Bay of Bengal last month. If all goes to plan, the spacecraft — which does not have any astronauts onboard — will deploy a 60-pound, solar-powered rover to explore the moon’s surface for two weeks. The mission’s stated objectives, according to the Indian Space Research Organization, are to land safely on the moon, deploy a rover and conduct scientific experiments.India’s Chandrayaan-1 mission in 2008 — which was crucial in the discovery of lunar water molecules — was an impact probe rather than the landing of a spacecraft.The country tried to land a spacecraft on the moon’s surface in 2019, but Chandrayaan-2 failed after contact was lost with the lander minutes before touchdown. “We came very close but we need to cover more ground,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at the time. “Our determination to touch the moon has become even stronger.”Only three nations — the United States, Russia (as the Soviet Union) and China — have successfully landed spacecraft on the moon’s surface.There’s another space race happening, though it’s a very different one from the Cold War-era competition between the United States and the Soviet Union.Countries including the United States — and India, with Chandrayaan-3 — are aiming to establish presences on or learn more about the south pole of the moon, where pools of ice could provide water for long-term settlements or act as a fueling station of sorts for space exploration.

{"id": 56, "Title": "Not everything is secret in encrypted apps like iMessage and WhatsApp", "Description": "This article is a preview of The Tech Friend newsletter. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Tuesday and Friday.One feature of apps such as iMessage and WhatsApp is that your texts or voice calls are scrambled and private from everyone.With end-to-end encrypted technology, no one but you and the intended recipients can know what you wrote or said — not hackers, the app companies or the police.Except, not everything is end-to-end encrypted in end-to-end encrypted apps.That could mean what you type in chats are saved on company computers that corporations such as Apple or your phone provider could read. Details such as the timestamps of every text to your boyfriend might not be under lock and key, either.That’s not necessarily bad. Each end-to-end encryption choice has trade-offs. More privacy and security could also make it harder for you to use an app, or can shield activity of terrorists and child predators.The mess I’m describing — end-to-end encryption but with certain exceptions — may be a healthy balance of your privacy and our safety.The problem is it’s confusing to know what is encrypted and secret in communications apps, what is not and why it might matter to you.To illuminate the nuances, I broke down five questions about end-to-end encryption for five communications apps.WhatsApp: YesApple’s Messages: NoMessages by Google: NoMeta Messenger: NoSignal: YesThe biggest encryption caveat is for the built-in texting apps on iPhones and most Android phones in the United States. Those are Apple’s Messages app, also known as iMessage, and the Messages by Google app.If you use Apple’s app, texts that you send and receive are only end-to-end encrypted if everyone else in the chat is using that app.If the text you see is in blue, the contents of messages are end-to-end encrypted for everyone in the chat.Even if Apple wanted to read your texts, it doesn’t have a key to unscramble those messages. (There’s a caveat in the next section about backup copies.)But the dreaded green bubbles are Apple’s warning. If you’re in a group chat with three people using Apple’s chat app and one person on an Android phone, no one’s texts are end-to-end encrypted.Each of your mobile phone providers might save every word of your communications. Those companies could, in theory, read your messages, lose them to thieves or hand them over to police with valid legal orders.Google’s chat app has the same encryption loophole. (For most people in the United States, Messages by Google is the standard texting app on Android phones.)Your texts in Google’s chat app are only end-to-end encrypted if everyone else is using that app.Google shows if your texts are end-to-end encrypted with signs such as a lock icon under texts and another on the send button.For most people using Meta Messenger, previously called Facebook Messenger, someone in a chat must turn on the option for your communications to be end-to-end encrypted.WhatsApp: YesApple’s Messages: NoMessages by Google: Yes*Meta Messenger: NoSignal: YesWhatsApp and Signal don’t let you save copies of your texts or call logs to the app makers’ computers.That means they don’t have saved message copies in a cloud that crooks could break into.But if you buy a new phone and forget your password, WhatsApp and Signal can’t really help you transfer all your old texts.If you back up copies from Apple’s chat app and Meta Messenger, the companies have the keys to unscramble what’s written in encrypted chat copies. Again, these unscrambled text copies can help in criminal investigations or they could be stolen or misused.Apple recently introduced a choice to fully end-to-end encrypt backup copies of iCloud accounts, which means not even Apple could unlock your scrambled backup texts.If you pick that option, Apple can’t help recover your chats if you forget your account password.This risk is why Apple makes this feature a pain to turn on, and requires you to list a plan B if you forget your password, such as a personal contact who knows your decryption code.WhatsApp has an option to save backup copies of your messages to Apple’s or Google’s cloud. WhatsApp doesn’t save those backups.For Messages by Google, the company says chats backed up to the company’s computers are automatically encrypted – as long as your Android phone has a screen that you need to unlock with a password or another method.Google gets an asterisk because it says it cannot unscramble your backup texts in its cloud. But it can for attachments like photos.Meta Messenger has been testing an option for people to turn on fully end-to-end encrypted backups.WhatsApp: YesApple’s Messages: YesMessages by Google: YesMeta Messenger: YesSignal: Yes*Most end-to-end encrypted apps save some “metadata,” or details about you or what you do with the app. They can retrieve the metadata if necessary.The app companies aren’t necessarily specific about which metadata they save and can unlock. This information can make you less private– and it can help in criminal prosecutions.WhatsApp, for example, may have your general physical location when you use the app and the names of your group chats. Under legal orders, WhatsApp has the ability to log the phone numbers your number communicates with.WhatsApp says these details can help identify spammers and aid in investigations of potential criminal activity including people who share images of child sexual abuse.Signal is a yes with an asterisk because it doesn’t save much the app can retrieve – just a phone number used to set up an account and the last time the account connected to Signal.WhatsApp: YesApple’s Messages: NoMessages by Google: NoMeta Messenger: YesSignal: YesEven with end-to-end encrypted texts, someone on the receiving end could leak them or turn them into the police.For extra privacy, WhatsApp, Meta Messenger, and Signal have an option to set texts to automatically delete in as little as 24 hours from the phones of everyone in a chat.This isn’t ironclad, either.

{"id": 57, "Title": "John Warnock, Adobe CEO who led desktop publishing revolution, dies at 82", "Description": "John Warnock, who played a seminal role in the history of computing as co-founder and chief executive of Adobe Inc., helping create the Portable Document Format (PDF) and software that turned computers into digital printing presses, radically reshaping office life and publishing, died Aug. 19 at 82.Adobe announced his death and said the cause was pancreatic cancer. The company provided his biography in a PDF.Mr. Warnock and Charles Geschke founded Adobe in 1982, naming it after a creek near their homes in Los Altos, Calif. PostScript, the company’s first piece of software, let computer users print documents just as they appeared on-screen, with graphics and multiple fonts — a task that previously required a trip to a local printing press.Apple was the first company to adopt the software, integrating it into its new LaserWriter printer. Other printer manufacturers soon followed.“When that first page came out of the LaserWriter, I was blown away,” Apple co-founder Steve Jobs told the tech journalist Pamela Pfiffner for her 2003 book “Inside the Publishing Revolution: The Adobe Story.” “No one had seen anything like this before. I held this page up in my hand and said, ‘Who will not want that?’ I knew then, as did John, that this was going to have a profound impact.”PostScript meant anyone essentially could run their own printing press, democratizing publishing and making Mr. Warnock and Geschke technological descendants of Johannes Gutenberg, the German inventor of the printing press. Adobe received letters and notes of thanks not long after the LaserWriter launched in 1985.“The first note we got was from these ladies who told us how excited they were to be able to publish their magazine,” Dan Putnam, one of Adobe’s first employees, said in Pfiffner’s book. “It was a lesbian newsletter, kind of pornographic in nature. The second newsletter that arrived was from a fundamentalist Christian sect. It wasn’t exactly what we had in mind, but we gave them the voice to present their point of view.”Jobs wanted to buy Adobe outright, but “we weren’t quite ready to be subservient to Steve,” Mr. Warnock told The Washington Post in 2021 after Geschke’s death.Other dynamic duos in Silicon Valley were better known — Jobs and Steve Wozniak at Apple, William Hewlett and David Packard at Hewlett-Packard — but Mr. Warnock and his co-founder led Adobe through a remarkable period of growth that made it one of the world’s largest software producers.Most of the company’s initial growth derived from Acrobat, introduced in 1993. The software ushered in the paperless office by letting computer users share documents as PDFs, preserving fonts and graphics regardless of the underlying software that created them.Acrobat did not catch on as quickly as PostScript.In a meeting with IBM executives, “I explained how it worked, what its advantages were and how, from any application, you could send a completely portable document across platforms,” Mr. Warnock said in an interview with a business journal published ​​by the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “They just sat there in the meeting with blank stares. They had no idea what I was talking about.”He recalled thinking, “How stupid can the world be?”Eventually, Acrobat’s merits became apparent.“The Centers for Disease Control was one of our earliest and most fanatical adopters,” Mr. Warnock told the Wharton journal. “They said, ‘Do you know how many people’s lives we can save by sending these documents out to all of the field offices?’ ... The IRS loved it.”Adobe’s other notable publishing products include Photoshop, PageMaker and Illustrator.Mr. Warnock, like Jobs, believed technology could serve a higher purpose.“We always felt that Apple should stand at the intersection of art and technology, and John felt the same way about Adobe,” Jobs said. “John had a developed aesthetic sense, too. We meshed together well.”Jobs and Adobe eventually would clash over Flash, Adobe’s streaming audio and video software, but the Apple co-founder maintained warm feelings toward Mr. Warnock. “John and I liked each other and trusted each other. I would have trusted him with my life, and I think he trusted me,” Jobs said.John Edward Warnock was born in Salt Lake City on Oct. 6, 1940. His father was a prominent lawyer.He struggled academically, failing ninth-grade algebra. After telling a high school guidance counselor he wanted become an engineer, she told him to consider another career. But by the time he graduated, John was acing every math problem he encountered.“I had an amazing teacher,” Mr. Warnock recalled, “... who, essentially, completely turned me around. He was really good at getting you to love mathematics, and that’s when I got into it.”Mr. Warnock studied math and philosophy at the University of Utah, graduating in 1961. He stayed at the university, receiving a master’s degree in math in 1964 and a doctorate in electrical engineering in 1969.He met Geschke while both worked as computer scientists at Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). They developed a printing protocol for computers and printers to communicate, but Xerox decided not to release it, so Mr. Warnock and Geschke left to start Adobe. They based PostScript on lessons they learned at PARC.Mr. Warnock served as chief executive for 16 years, retiring in 2001. President Barack Obama awarded Mr. Warnock and Geschke the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2008In 1965, he married Marva Mullins. In addition to his wife, survivors include three children.Mr. Warnock keenly understood the disruptive power of his software, especially in combination with the internet. In a 2001 interview with the Associated Press, he was asked whether paper would one day lose its importance.“It will as a transportation media,” he said. “If you think of paper as something you hold and read, I don’t think it’ll lose its importance for that, but in getting that information from me to you, I think it will.”Knight-Ridder, the once-powerful and now defunct newspaper chain, was one of several companies that appointed Mr. Warnock to their boards.“At the first board meeting,” Mr. Warnock recalled in a separate Wharton business journal interview, “I said, ‘You guys need to decide whether you are in the communication business or in the newspaper business.’ And I said, ‘If you decide that you are in the newspaper business, you’re toast.’”", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/08/22/john-warnock-adobe-ceo-who-led-desktop-publishing-revolution-dies/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 22, 2023 at 12:08 p.m. EDT", "Tag": "Technology", "Keywords": "PDF, PostScript, Publishing"}
{"id": 58, "Title": "Traffic on Meta’s Threads is declining as company adds features", "Description": "As Meta tries to revive flagging interest in its Threads social media offering, the company is launching a desktop version of its rival to Elon Musk’s Twitter, now called X.Meta on Tuesday announced it’s launching a version of Threads that can be used on web browsers, which will roll out to users in the coming days. The text-based platform originally was only available through smartphone apps when it debuted last month.“Actual footage of me building Threads for web,” Mark Zuckerberg posted on the app Tuesday, next to a picture of the young Meta CEO in what appeared to be his college dorm room.When Threads first appeared in early July, it was widely seen as an alternative to Twitter. Although Threads had attracted more than 100 million sign-ups less than a week after it was unveiled, it has struggled to maintain its early momentum, according to third-party analytics firms.Daily active android users on Threads peaked on July 7 at 49.3 million only to plummet to 10.3 million a month later on Aug. 7, according to estimates from website-tracking firm SimilarWeb. And even users who do go to Threads are spending less time on the app than they once did, according to SimilarWeb.Web browser capability is one of several features Meta has been pushing out to Threads over the past several weeks.Meta is done moderating. On Threads, users decide what they see.But even as Meta expands the functionality of Threads, experts say it faces an uphill battle to rebuild  interest in the app and ensure there is a steady flow of engaging content to keep people coming back. The declining user engagement on Threads shows the pitfalls companies sometimes face when they push out a minimally viable product, betting that future updates will attract more customers.“They can’t just have one toe in the water. They have to dive into the deep end of the pool,” said Daniel Ives, a senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities. “I think there’s still a lot of questions of how committed they are” to Threads.Meta decided to ramp up its work on a stand-alone text-based app that could woo creators over from Twitter during a meeting last winter between CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Instagram head Adam Mosseri and other leaders. The company pushed up the launch of Threads by a week after Musk decided to cap the number of tweets users could view each day on Twitter, angering longtime fans of the social network.Move fast and beat Musk: The inside story of how Meta built ThreadsWithin hours, the app attracted millions of users including some big-time names such as Kim Kardashian, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). Some cited their frustration with Twitter as a reason they were rooting for the new app.Executives cautioned from the beginning that they need to improve the Threads app for it to become a long-term success. Mosseri told The Washington Post that he is focusing on making sure the team behind Threads builds out basic features, such as helping users build their lists of people to follow, improving the algorithms that decide what users see and figuring out how to let people message each other.With Threads sign-ups surging past 30M, Zuckerberg notches a winMeta has already shipped several Threads updates including offering users the option to see chronological feeds of posts only from people they follow rather than algorithmically driven feeds from users across the platform.The company also announced last week that users could share a post on Threads in a direct message on Instagram. Adding that ability coincided with an incremental gain in daily users, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, although it estimates the daily active user total on Threads is still down 75 percent from launch.But its main rival has been stagnating — according to data from SimilarWeb, Musk’s platform has experienced sporadic declines in usage over the past year, since he first announced his plans to buy Twitter.“I think they’re all facing head winds,” Ives said of text-based social media in general. “Monetization continues to be the issue, but the engagement on Twitter is unmatched.”", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/22/meta-threads-desktop/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 22, 2023 at 9:01 a.m. EDT", "Tag": "Technology", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 59, "Title": "Trudeau joins calls for Meta to reverse news ban amid Canada wildfires", "Description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau denounced Meta’s decision to block the sharing of news articles on its platforms as wildfires continued to devastate swaths of the Northwest Territories and British Columbia, forcing thousands to flee.“It is so inconceivable that a company like Facebook is choosing to put corporate profits ahead of ensuring that local news organizations can get up-to-date information to Canadians,” Trudeau said at a news conference Monday.Meta began blocking news links for Facebook and Instagram users in Canada in June after the country passed a law that allows news organizations to negotiate with tech giants to receive payments for articles shared on their platforms.The ban by Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has rankled Canadian authorities trying to share evacuation information this week across a remote swath of the country where social media is key to disseminating news.“What Meta is doing currently is unacceptable,” said Pablo Rodriguez, Canada’s transportation minister, at a news briefing Friday. “We’ve seen that, throughout this emergency, Canadians have not had access to the crucial information they need. So, I ask Meta to reverse its decision, allow Canadians to have access to news on their platforms.”The evacuation orders in western Canada expanded Friday as the fires spread across the region, and officials declared a state of emergency in Kelowna, a 150,000-person city 170 miles east of Vancouver. Officials had previously urged all 20,000 residents of Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories, to leave the city by noon local time Friday as wind gusts strengthened. Some went by plane, some by car.Meta’s ban on sharing news is the most recent development in its years-long battle to oppose regulatory proposals around the world that seek to boost the languishing media industry by forcing social media companies to pay for content. Proponents of regulation have argued that social media platforms are the predominant beneficiaries of the digital advertising gained from news articles, and should share some of that revenue with publishers.But Meta says the share of revenue drawn from news content is overstated and argues that media outlets benefit from subscriptions and increased readership because their stories are posted on its platforms.Officials in Canada say the impact of the news ban has been evident during the wildfires crisis.“Meta’s reckless choice to block news before the Act is in force is hurting access to vital information on Facebook and Instagram,” wrote Pascale St-Onge, the minister of Canadian heritage, on X, formerly known as Twitter. “We are calling on them to reinstate news sharing today for the safety of Canadians facing this emergency. We need more news right now, not less.”The Facebook page for the city of Yellowknife urged residents Thursday to search on Google for the website owned by CPAC, a Canadian broadcast channel, for wildfire updates. “Due to the recent change in Legislation, the City is unable to share the link because it’s a media source,” the municipality wrote.Catherine Tait, the president and chief executive of CBC and Radio-Canada, said the national public broadcaster is one of the few ways residents of the affected areas can find out what’s happening beyond government news releases or emergency warnings.CBC Northwest Territories has 41,000 followers on its Facebook page, while the territory has a population of about 46,000. Because of the remoteness of the region, it is sometimes difficult for the news organization to reach people there. Facebook helped it to do so, playing a “disproportion role in sharing our information,” Tait told The Post.“It’s like having your telephone taken away from you, or your radio taken away from you,” Tait said of the ban. The chief executive noted that her organization provides news in Indigenous languages, and the social networks are crucial in reaching younger populations.Tait said she is asking Meta, at a minimum, to reverse the ban until the danger from the wildfires subsides.On Friday, Meta spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement that “people in Canada can continue to use our technologies to connect with their communities and access reputable information, including content from official government agencies, emergency services and nongovernmental organizations.”News/Media Alliance President Danielle Coffey, whose group has advocated for proposals similar to Canada’s new law, said Meta should lift the ban in light of the crisis.“When the pandemic hit, our newspapers took our paywall down because we thought it was our public duty,” she said, adding that Meta, by contrast, is “surgically withholding news and critical information because of a business decision.”Meta has previously threatened to pull news from its platforms in protest of similar proposals in Australia and California. The Australian law has been credited with directing millions to news outlets from Meta and Google. Lawmakers in Washington have also considered passing a temporary carve-out in antitrust law to allow publishers to band together to negotiate with the tech giants over the distribution of their content. Neither the California proposal nor the antitrust bill in Congress has yet to pass.“They decided that news is no longer a priority” for their platforms, Tait said of Meta’s actions in Canada. “Well, guess what? It is a priority for your users.”", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/18/meta-news-ban-canada-wildfires/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 18, 2023 at 9:31 p.m. EDT", "Tag": "Technology", "Keywords": "1. wildfire\n2.

{"id": 60, "Title": "How a Christie’s website revealed where people kept their art", "Description": "On a recent Wednesday evening, a university professor in a large town in western Germany was preparing several paintings to be sold through the British auction house Christie’s. Using his iPhone, he took pictures of the inherited works at his home to upload to the company’s website. Within a few weeks, the site promised, Christie’s would give him an estimate of their value and tell him if it was interested in auctioning them.But by uploading the images, he not only sent pictures of the pieces to Christie’s, he also revealed their exact location for anyone to see online, according to two German cybersecurity researchers. Hundreds of other would-be Christie’s clients, including Americans, were exposed to the same vulnerability, the two researchers, Martin Tschirsich and André Zilch, told The Washington Post.The findings show how cybersecurity vulnerabilities aren’t just an issue for Big Tech companies, but for almost everyone as more and more business is transacted over the internet. As was the case with the professor, photos uploaded to Christie’s oftentimes include GPS coordinates for where they were taken; those coordinates are so precise that they reveal not just a street address but can even indicate within a few feet exactly where inside a building a photo was taken. “Around 10 percent of the uploaded images contain exact GPS coordinates,” the researchers said.At the end of July, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned generally about the kind of vulnerability the German researchers found. “[These vulnerabilities] have resulted in the compromise of personal, financial, and health information of millions of users and consumers,” CISA said in a joint statement with the National Security Agency and the Australian Cyber Security Center, without referring explicitly to any developments at the auction house.Christie’s, which says it’s committed to treating personal data with the utmost care and security but has also been criticized for offering anonymity to clients, declined to answer questions about or confirm the researchers’ findings. “We continuously assess our security safeguards, thoroughly address issues relating to the security of our clients’ information, and comply with our legal and regulatory obligations,” the auction house said in a statement.The company seems to have taken steps to resolve the issue, according to the researchers, though only after being contacted about it by The Post. “It was only Tuesday when Christie’s appears to have implemented technical measures to close the vulnerability,” Tschirsich said. He said the researchers had informed Christie’s about the problem more than two months ago.It is unclear if Christie’s has informed any of its clients about the security lapse. The German professor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to discuss a breach of his personal data that may have been easily accessible to everyone online, said Christie’s had not contacted him. He said he learned his artworks’ location had been made public from The Post. “Especially with a renowned house like Christie’s, I would not have expected that,” he said.Tschirsich and Zilch say they had alerted Christie’s to what they called a “serious vulnerability” by the time the professor had uploaded his images. Messages viewed by The Post show they first told Christie’s of the vulnerability in June. An offer by the researchers to help resolve the difficulty was rejected by a Christie’s executive, according to records the researchers shared with The Post. “Thank you, but we do not require any advice or assistance,” the executive said, after confirming that the researchers’ findings had been forwarded to an internal security team.“As cybersecurity researchers we were very surprised by this reaction,” Zilch said.Some tech companies routinely pay a fee to researchers who reveal a vulnerability that on the black market could be worth an even higher prize. Larger companies also have what are called bug bounty programs to incentivize cybersecurity researchers to report flaws that can lead to breaches. However, Christie’s does not appear to advertise such a program.Tschirsich and Zilch say they were not looking for a bounty or a job from Christie’s, but just wanted the company to fix a vulnerability that put users at risk. Both for years have probed systems for vulnerabilities with the goal of reporting them to companies and organizations, often free of charge. In the past, the two have identified vulnerabilities putting the health data of patients in Germany at risk. Tschirsich, together with other researchers, also uncovered problems in German election software that could have disrupted the counting of votes. Both problems were investigated  at no charge and fixed after the researchers warned the affected organizations about them.The German researchers took a look at Christie’s after an acquaintance asked them about how secure its service was. “Unfortunately, it only took us a few minutes to come across this serious vulnerability,” Tschirsich told The Post. “The vulnerability is so simple that it can be exploited by anyone with a browser within a few minutes.”Tschirsich said Christie’s lack of a quick response surprised him. “It actually takes only a few hours to temporarily close the vulnerability and two days to completely fix the problem,” Zilch said.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/21/christies-security-breach-location/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 21, 2023 at 8:00 a.m. EDT", "Tag": "Technology", "Keywords": "Christie's, vulnerability, cybersecurity."}
{"id": 61, "Title": "Improve your chances of getting noticed by AI on job sites with these tips", "Description": "If you’re looking for work on popular job sites and not finding much luck, you’re not alone.Job seekers are finding it increasingly difficult to stand out among a growing number of applications for roles on sites such as LinkedIn, Indeed and ZipRecruiter. Meanwhile, the sites’ artificial intelligence used to match candidates with jobs isn’t always solely judging a person’s skills, but also the historical behavior of employers on the sites. While the process may feel overwhelming, job seekers have the power to understand what’s happening and position themselves to land their next gigs.“In the most aspirational sense, one thing a large platform might be able to do that you might struggle with on your own” is help you explore new options, said Manish Raghavan, an assistant professor of information technology and computer science at the MIT Sloan School of Management. “There’s a finite number of jobs that you know about. There are more you don’t.”Here are some things job seekers can do to get the most out of job sites.The most basic thing people can do is fill out their full profile. The skills field is particularly important on LinkedIn, as it recently rolled out a skills-matching filter that helps recruiters see which of your skills are relevant to the job. LinkedIn also allows job seekers to tag up to five top skills in the “about” section at the top of their profiles. ZipRecruiter said its systems focus on employment, education, skills, and licenses and certifications.The most basic thing people can do is fill out their full profile.

ZipRecruiter said its systems focus on employment, education, skills, and licenses and certifications.Double-check that all information from any résumé you upload to a job site is properly parsed into your profile. Sometimes systems may confuse or cut off fields or have trouble reading your résumé’s format. Indeed suggests you have both a profile and an uploaded résumé on its site so it can provide better job matches. LinkedIn also allows the job seeker to save a résumé and show it to recruiters by switching the “share résumé data with recruiters” toggle to on after applying for a job.“If you’re going to be on a platform, have a reasonably complete profile,” Raghavan said. “It’s not much effort to have a basic profile with the important points.”Sometimes providing more information about your skills or experiences will increase your chances of being noticed by AI bots or human recruiters.Sometimes providing more information about your skills or experiences will increase your chances of being noticed by AI bots or human recruiters.ZipRecruiter says the more information its system can see, the more likely something will align. However, candidates also should consider how much information they want in the public sphere. While the benefit may be better visibility to employers, there is also a privacy cost, Raghavan said.Recruiters and AI systems sometimes filter for keywords to find good matches. One way to approach keywords is to look at several openings for a type of job you’re seeking and pay attention to the words they have in common. Then include those that best apply to you and demonstrate how you’ve used those skills or qualifications, Indeed suggests. Consider changing any uncommon job titles to more commonly used ones and avoid abbreviations, ZipRecruiter said.Recruiters and AI systems sometimes filter for keywords to find good matches.

LinkedIn’s aforementioned skills-matching filter isn’t just helpful for recruiters, but job seekers also can use it to compare the skills they list on their profiles to open roles.Several job sites are trying to present roles for candidates that will not only fit their skill sets but also will match ones they may not have previously considered. Raghavan said one way to help sites may be to ensure that you’re regularly searching for and clicking on roles you want the sites to recommend. That may help the sites understand your preferences, he said.Several job sites are trying to present roles for candidates that will not only fit their skill sets but also will match ones they may not have previously considered.

{"id": 62, "Title": "NASA spacecraft reunites with Earth after 17-year trip around the sun", "Description": "For nearly 17 years, NASA’s Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-A spacecraft drifted through space on a lonely mission. It traveled around the sun far ahead of Earth, conducting groundbreaking research on the solar system’s star.Like many NASA spacecraft, STEREO-A outlived its mission life span of two years. Instead, it traveled further and further away from Earth on a journey that became fraught with uncertainty as it passed behind the sun in 2015, temporarily severing contact with NASA. The same year, the agency lost contact with STEREO-A’s sibling vessel, STEREO-B, which was traveling a similar path.But STEREO-A kept going. And its orbital trajectory around the sun meant that it had a chance to do what very few other NASA spacecraft could: eventually make its way back toward home.That came to fruition earlier this month, when STEREO-A passed between the sun and the Earth for the first time since its launch in 2006, NASA announced. The flyby marked a milestone for the spacecraft and the team that has monitored its progress — and a chance for STEREO-A to prove its relevance almost two decades later. As it continues to pass by Earth, STEREO-A will be used to perform new research on the sun, aided by newer NASA satellites that have been developed since its launch.“This is a point in time for this mission to shine again,” Lika Guhathakurta, STEREO’s program scientist, told The Washington Post.The two STEREO spacecraft launched in October 2006 with an ambitious mission: to generate a 360-degree view of the sun by observing the star from two vantage points as they circled it on orbits that diverged from the Earth in opposite directions. STEREO-A maneuvered into an orbit around the sun ahead of Earth, and STEREO-B began circling the sun in the opposite direction behind the Earth.The difference in perspective was groundbreaking, Guhathakurta said. Earthbound instruments can only ever observe one Earth-facing slice of the sun at a time, while the rest of the rapidly changing solar surface remains obscured. The twin STEREO spacecraft, from their offset positions, allowed scientists to capture a 360-degree view of the sun for the first time, a feat that still awes Guhathakurta.“Seeing the sun from the front and from the far side at the same time — extraordinary,” she said. “We are on planet Earth, human beings, and we are achieving that.”The STEREO craft also allowed scientists to better study the sun’s roiling surface and the hazards that erupt from it. The two craft, operating the same way two eyes create depth perception, provided a three-dimensional view of the sun and of coronal mass ejections — a phenomenon in which plumes of plasma and magnetic field shoot outward from the sun’s outer atmosphere at hundreds or thousands of miles per second, potentially threatening Earth’s power grid and satellites, as well as other planets and NASA spacecraft. That imagery allowed scientists to track the shape, density and velocity of coronal mass ejections as they rippled across the solar system.As STEREO-A and STEREO-B continued on their orbits, they neared the far side of the sun in 2014. It was a testament to how far they’d traveled, but also a huge risk — moving directly behind the sun would sever communication between the spacecraft and NASA for a period of several months.The two wayward spacecraft, years past their expiration dates, had not been designed to operate without communication from NASA for that long. While conducting tests in preparation for the downtime, the agency lost contact with STEREO-B. NASA briefly regained contact with the spacecraft in 2016 but determined that a malfunctioning component had sent it into an uncontrollable spin, leaving it unable to orient its antenna or solar panels properly, and the agency gave up on recovery efforts.STEREO-A, however, emerged from the far side of the sun unscathed — and began the long trip back toward Earth. Earlier this month, the spacecraft passed between Earth and the sun, coming within around 5 million miles of Earth, according to NASA.The spacecraft arrived back near Earth at an opportune time, Guhathakurta said. When STEREO-A was launched 17 years ago, it viewed the sun during a solar minimum, a low point in the sun’s 11-year cycle of high and low solar activity. That limited the number of coronal mass ejections and other phenomena that the spacecraft initially observed. This year, STEREO-A’s return has coincided with a period of intense solar activity.And its flyby means it can finally return to the work it once performed with its lost sibling. A capable fleet of satellites and probes near Earth will help STEREO-A re-create the 3D imaging of the sun it once captured with STEREO-B, the agency said.STEREO-A will continue to work on the edge of solar physics. Scientists hope to use the new data gathered during the spacecraft’s flyby to examine a recent theory that coronal loops — giant arcs of solar material that crisscross the sun’s surface when viewed in ultraviolet light — may be optical illusions.For Guhathakurta, who began working on the STEREO mission in 1998, STEREO-A’s perseverance after such a long journey is heartening.“It’s like seeing your children grow up and do extraordinary things,” Guhathakurta said. She added that STEREO-A’s mission may not be finished, depending on NASA’s budgeting decisions. Either way, STEREO-A will continue on its course for another orbit around the sun.“They don’t stay home,” Guhathakurta added, laughing. “They drift away very quickly.”", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/08/20/nasa-stereo-a-earth-flyby/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 20, 2023 at 7:55 p.m. EDT", "Tag": "Technology", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 63, "Title": "What can my nails tell me about my health?", "Description": "Q: I’ve noticed some odd changes to my nails that weren’t there before. What can our nails tell us about our health? And how can I keep my nails healthy?A: Our nails are a unique window into our overall health. Many diseases are associated with distinctive nail changes — from the spoon-shaped nails of iron deficiency anemia to the rounded, swollen nails of cystic fibrosis.In my third year of medical school, I met a patient who had come to the emergency room throwing up blood. After directing the rest of the team to stabilize the patient, the doctor in charge held the patient’s hand and looked closely at their fingernails. They were a frosty white, except for a strip of red at the tips. I’ve never forgotten that appearance (a finding known as “Terry’s nails”), or how the doctor turned to me and said, “I bet this patient has cirrhosis.”Ask a Doctor: Got a health question? We’ll find the right expert to answer it.At first I was incredulous — how could she guess the patient had a liver problem of all things just by looking at the fingernails? But she was right: The patient had complications from cirrhosis.Here are some common nail changes that can tell you something about your health:Tracey Vlahovic, clinical professor in the department of podiatric medicine at Temple University, said that nail changes, like those that occur with psoriatic arthritis, might be an early sign of a systemic issue.Keep in mind: Nails grow slowly (it takes about six months to regrow a fingernail), so not only could an abnormality reflect an illness that occurred several months prior, but any treatment prescribed to you may take time before you see results.Since we’re talking about nails, it’s important to note that while manicures and pedicures may be visually appealing, they’re probably not doing much for the “health” of your nail, and some practices may be damaging.Take pushing back cuticles, for example. You may have thought that the rather uncomfortable shoving and trimming of the cuticles is a necessary evil and that cuticles serve you no purpose.Not so. Removing cuticles, in fact, increases the risk of an infection.“Both your cuticles and the tip of your nail are there to keep the environment outside of the body,” said Vlahovic. “Scraping or pushing those areas back opens doors that should not be opened.”She recommends only having nails filed and polished, or going to a spa that offers medical pedicures with instruments that have been sterilized with an autoclave device.Popular gel manicures can lead to thinning of the nail plate and brittle nails due to the repeated application and removal process (often involving soaking with acetone and mechanical peeling). And I know I’m not in alone in having entered a Faustian bargain by wanting to cover damaged nails from a gel manicure with … another gel manicure.Many supplements purporting nail growth contain biotin (and are taken daily by nearly 3 percent of U.S. adults). But according to the American Academy of Dermatology, there is no evidence that biotin promotes nail growth or quality in otherwise healthy people.And taking biotin isn’t harmless: Biotin can interfere with blood tests such as troponin, used commonly to help diagnose a heart attack, and lead to a false negative result. This could have serious consequences, especially among women for whom heart attacks are already underdiagnosed.Nail health is not something you want to self-treat. It’s easy to get the diagnosis wrong because many nail issues look similar. If you’ve noticed changes to the shape, texture or even color of your nails, talk to your provider about whether there’s any cause for concern.Meet the doctor: Trisha S.

{"id": 64, "Title": "Blue-light glasses may not reduce eyestrain from screens, study says", "Description": "Blue-light filtering glasses may not reduce eyestrain associated with computer use, and their effect on improving sleep quality and retinal health is unclear, a review published Thursday says.“Our review doesn’t support using a blue-light filtering lens if you’re a healthy adult for the purpose of reducing eyestrain with computer use,” said Laura Downie, the review’s senior author and an associate professor of optometry and vision sciences at the University of Melbourne.The review of 17 randomized controlled trials, published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, confirms what eye-care professionals have said for some time about the popular glasses.“There’s really been no evidence that blue-light blocking glasses have any health benefits or even ocular benefits when it comes to eyes,” said Rahul Khurana, a vitreoretinal surgeon and spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology who was not involved in the study.Eyewear companies such as Warby Parker and Felix Gray promote the glasses’ potential to consumers. Warby Parker’s website states that “if screen time is affecting your sleep, blue-light-filtering lenses may help.” Felix Gray says on its webpage that wearing blue-light blocking glasses can reduce conditions such as eye fatigue, dry eyes and eyestrain. Neither company responded to email requests for comment.Some makers of prescription glasses can charge extra fees — as much as $50 — for lenses that include blue-light blocking.Blue light is a part of the visible light spectrum that has relatively short wavelengths, Downie said. We are exposed to blue light from digital devices and — at much higher levels — the sun.Some eyewear companies claim that blue light emitted from our screens is a cause of eyestrain, but the American Academy of Ophthalmology has stated that blue light does not cause eyestrain, nor does it damage retinas or lead to diseases such as macular degeneration. The academy said studies on blue light showing damage to cells were conducted on cells in a dish and in animals. The experiments did not “mimic the natural conditions of blue light exposure to live human eyes and did not use blue light from computer screens,” the academy said in an article.Eyestrain can happen when we look at screens for too long, Khurana said.“Your eyelids normally blink 15 times a minute,” he said. “But when you’re concentrating on something, like looking at a screen or looking at a computer, your blink reflex goes down to maybe five to seven times a minute, and as a result, your eyes dry out.”Eyestrain symptoms include tired, burning or sore eyes, and even blurred vision, Downie said.Three of the 17 trials in the review evaluated blue-light reflecting lenses and eyestrain. The common outcome measure was a subjective visual fatigue score. All three trials, with a combined 166 participants, reported no significant difference in visual fatigue between those wearing blue-light filtering lenses compared with those wearing lenses that don’t filter blue light.The review showed “expected findings,” said Kevin M. Miller, a professor of clinical ophthalmology at the University of California at Los Angeles who was not involved in the study.“When the optical shop tries to talk you into the blue blocker, just say, ‘I don’t think so,’ ” he said. “That would be my response.”Our brain has an internal clock known as the circadian rhythm that regulates, among other things, sleep. Light and darkness can affect this rhythm; short-wavelength light, such as blue light, is preferentially absorbed by photoreceptive cells in the retina that have the most effect on the biological clock. The light also suppresses the hormone melatonin which signals darkness.Bright light, especially short-wavelength light, from devices, for instance, at night can confuse the biological clock and may make it hard to go to sleep or stay asleep.The idea behind blue-blocking lenses is to stop the light from entering the eye and throwing the circadian rhythm off; however, this has not been established with any degree of certainty in clinical studies, Miller said.The review examined six studies with a total of 148 participants on the effect of blue-light filtering glasses on sleep quality. The findings were inconsistent, Downie said, with three studies finding a significant improvement in sleep scores and three others reporting no significant difference between blue-light-filtering glasses and glasses with no blue-light filter.Downie added that the patients in the studies had sleep or mood disorders. “They weren’t evaluating interventions in the general population,” she said. “So we can’t make any statement around the potential utility in relation to sleep in general, healthy adults.”The review also found “little or no effect” with blue-light filtering lenses on visual performance and daytime alertness.“Uncertainty in these effects was due to lack of available data and the small number of studies reporting these outcomes,” the authors wrote in the review.Downie said the researchers attempted to look at the impact of blue-light filtering lenses on contrast sensitivity, color vision and whether there was any difference in what the authors called “discomfort glare” — a phenomenon where you get eye discomfort from bright light sources.None of the studies reported on those outcomes, so the researchers could not draw any conclusions about possible effects of blue-light filtering lenses on the effect on the health of the back of the eye, Downie said.There are things people can consider besides buying blue light glasses, experts say.If the eyestrain persists, see an eye-care health professional who can perform a thorough examination of your eye health, Downie said. “Sometimes eyestrain can be actually caused by an underlying eye health or vision problem,” she said.Sign up for the Well+Being newsletter, your source of expert advice and simple tips to help you live well every day", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/08/17/blue-light-filter-glasses-eye/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 17, 2023", "Tag": "Health", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 65, "Title": "What’s that stuff in your bellybutton? Science has the answer.", "Description": "Q: I’ve noticed stuff inside my bellybutton from time to time. What is it, and how often should I be cleaning it out?A: There’s been a remarkable amount of science devoted to the seemingly unimportant topic of what lurks in our bellybuttons.One intrepid scientist analyzed his own navel fluff: Georg Steinhauser — of the Vienna University of Technology in Austria — collected 503 pieces of bellybutton junk over three years. Upon elemental analysis, he found that bellybutton lint contains house dust, skin cells and sweat in addition to the fibers of shirts.After additional (and no doubt scintillating) investigations of his friends, family and colleagues, he concluded that abdominal hair was a prerequisite for accumulating navel lint and that old T-shirts or dress shirts were less likely to produce fluff than new clothing.The scientist even shaved his own belly for the purposes of confirming his abdominal hair hypothesis.Steinhauser speculated that people who collect navel lint may have more hygienic bellybuttons than those who don’t because all the extra junk is swept up by lint instead of sticking to the skin. But, as for the cleaning part of the question: It’s recommended to clean your bellybutton just as you would any other part of your skin.Besides abdominal hair and new clothing, there are a few other factors that shape why and how we accumulate junk in our bellybuttons.Karl Kruszelnicki of the University of Sydney in Australia surveyed 4,799 people and observed that being male, having an “innie” rather than “outie” and older age were all associated with accumulating more lint. His work was among the winners of the 2002 Ig Nobel Prize, which is awarded to humorous scientific achievements.And as further proof that true selfless pursuit of knowledge knows no bounds, in 2018, a mechanical engineer from the Indian Institute of Technology Patna decided he was going to ask the real tough questions: What are the physics behind bellybutton lint production, and can it be mathematically modeled?He determined that microscopically, body hair acts like a saw-tooth to extricate lint fibers from fabric during the periodic motion of our respiratory cycle — inhaling and exhaling — wherein our shirts rub constantly against our abdomens. Because the hair in that area tends to stoop toward the depression of the navel, the lint fibers hooked onto them travel deep into the bellybutton, eventually losing contact with the fabric.As the influx of lint continues, it intermingles with sweat and skin cells, and the result is a nice, compact mass of fluff that accumulates with mathematical precision. It begins linearly, then grows quadratically with time, if you must know.Maybe you don’t collect lint in your bellybutton, but you do find dirt from time to time. That’s also normal, especially with “innies” for whom the bellybutton, after all, is a small crevice with multiple tiny skin folds perfect for trapping oils and sweat. Infections are rare, but if you notice pain or discharge from the area, talk to your doctor.Several studies have examined the microorganisms present both within the bellybutton and in umbilical dirt, which is mostly just dead skin cells. The most common genus in umbilical dirt is Corynebacterium, a generally harmless microbe that’s abundant in other moister areas of the body such as inside the nose and armpits.The self-cleansing rituals that each of us considers most “hygienic” differs. From a medical perspective, we can all agree on certain practices like washing away any visible dirt or grime or hand-washing while preparing food or after using the toilet. Showering or bathing frequency is more subjective, however. When in doubt, check with your doctor.Meet the doctor: Trisha S.

{"id": 66, "Title": "Medical Mysteries: Why did a teen collapse mid-jump on a trampoline?", "Description": "A mood of jittery anticipation pervaded the emergency department of Children’s National Hospital in Washington late on a Saturday afternoon in September 2022 as a team of nearly two dozen nurses, doctors and technicians awaited the arrival of a 14-year-old boy.Akinbiyi Akinwumi, known as BB, had suddenly collapsed at an indoor trampoline park near his home in Prince George’s County, Md. He quickly regained consciousness but had trouble speaking and was complaining of chest pain and numbness. Paramedics called to the scene noted an unusual and worrisome elevation on his electrocardiogram and wondered if he might be having a heart attack — a vanishingly rare event in someone so young.By the time the ambulance crew hustled him into the hospital’s trauma bay, BB was looking around the room, a good sign to Gil Wernovsky, the critical care cardiologist who was the first doctor to see him.BB’s blood pressure and heart rate were reassuringly normal and Wernovsky mentally ticked through a list of possible causes of his collapse: dehydration; a heart rhythm disturbance known as an arrhythmia; sepsis, a life-threatening infection; myocarditis, a rare but serious inflammation of the heart wall; a drug overdose or even Lyme disease.The pediatric cardiology fellow began to perform an echocardiogram, a test that uses ultrasound to assess heart function.As an image flashed on the screen, Wernovsky recalled, there was a collective “audible gasp, followed by complete silence.”There, in terrifying detail, was the cause of BB’s problem — and of the months of unexplained fatigue, dizziness and chest pain that preceded it.The ER team immediately mobilized to prepare BB and his family for emergency surgery. “We had to move very quickly,” Wernovsky said. “We really didn’t know if we were minutes away from … a fatality.”BB’s mother, Shron Akinwumi, remembers feeling simultaneously bewildered by what doctors were telling her and intent on projecting the brave face her younger son badly needed. She and her husband, Akin, a physician and epidemiologist, signed consent forms, answered questions about do-not-resuscitate orders and tried to process the warning that their previously healthy child could die in surgery.“Look, I just want you to save my son,” Shron remembers telling doctors before he was wheeled into the operating room.BB’s fraught diagnosis was in sharp contrast to his unusually rapid recovery. Less than four days after the teenager arrived, critically ill, in an ambulance, he went home.“He recovered so fast we barely had time to talk to him,” Wernovsky said.For months before he wound up at Children’s National, BB, a basketball player, had felt pain in his chest, numbness in his arm and periods of fatigue and sluggishness that he largely avoided mentioning to his mother or anyone else. His symptoms were “very random,” recalled Shron, director of patient access at GW Medical Faculty Associates.When she asked the pediatrician about the pain in BB’s chest, the doctor told her he might have pulled a muscle — one of the most common causes of pediatric chest pain — and advised that he take Tylenol, which seemed to help. During previous visits doctors hadn’t found anything out of the ordinary.In early August, six weeks before he fainted at the trampoline park, BB had gone to a Maryland gym with his older brother, Akintola. While working out he complained of feeling dizzy, “tingly and generally not right” and then briefly passed out. He called his mother.“I said, ‘Sit down, I’ll come get you,’” Shron recalled. She arrived to find him perched on a curb in the parking lot, where he had vomited. BB had been wearing a hoodie and Shron thought he might be suffering from heat stroke or a migraine with aura. For two years he had experienced infrequent headaches, which typically responded to over-the-counter medicine.Once home, BB took a brief nap. When he awoke and said he didn’t remember being at the gym, Shron initially thought he was joking. When she realized he wasn’t, she called 911. Paramedics examined him; his vital signs were normal but an EMT suggested she take him to Children’s National.Shron raced to the scene, then followed the ambulance to Children’s National.As the roomful of people stared silently at the image on the screen, BB spoke up. “That’s not supposed to be there,” he said, sounding both incredulous and fearful. A large growth shaped like a stalk of cauliflower was attached to his heart; it resembled a tree swaying in a hurricane. “I was just in shock,” he said.The ER cardiologists tried to break the news gently, Shron recalled. That odd-looking mass attached to the left side of BB’s heart was a tumor. It wasn’t clear if it was benign or malignant, Wernovsky told Shron, but it had to come out immediately.Wernovsky said he was virtually certain the tumor was a cardiac myxoma — a mass that is rare in adults and even rarer in children. In his 38-year career the cardiologist has seen two others: one in a newborn, the other in a 10-year-old.Myxomas are nearly always benign, although BB’s was “in a malignant place. I can’t think of a scarier activity than jumping on a trampoline,” Wernovsky noted, because the huge tumor easily could have blocked blood flow to BB’s heart, killing him instantly.“As much as I wanted to reassure her that it was benign, I couldn’t,” he added. “You can’t be sure until you take it out.”“ ‘Do what you need to do,’ ” was Shron’s response, Wernovsky recalled. “She really had her stuff together. She was a great advocate for her son.”Shron said her most vivid memory is of trying to reassure BB. “When someone who barely talks says ‘Mommy, I don’t want to die … ,’” she said, her voice trailing off. “I said, ‘You’re not going to die. They do these surgeries every day.’ ”The cause of cardiac myxomas, which typically affect the heart’s upper chamber, is largely unknown. Many are diagnosed in women between the ages of 30 and 60 and are discovered incidentally during a work-up for something else. About 10 percent are believed to result from a rare genetic disorder called Carney syndrome, but most occur randomly, as did BB’s.Surgical removal is the recommended treatment for the tumors, which rarely recur.Shron said she spent much of the five hours BB was in surgery watching “Downton Abbey” on her iPad in an attempt to distract herself. She said she suspected her husband was “more nervous than me because [as a doctor] he knows what can happen.” Both tried to manage their anxieties and comfort their older son.Surgery went well. Within a day BB was moved out of the cardiac intensive care unit. Shron remembers asking why so many doctors were coming to see him and was told that the visits were prompted by the rarity of his tumor and the speed of his recovery. “They kept saying, ‘You’re defying this or doing that,’ ” she said.But her reserves of strength were not limitless. Shron said she “had a full blown meltdown” as the family drove home from the hospital. “I looked back at him and the reality of what happened” engulfed her and she began weeping. She slept in a chair in BB’s room for two weeks until he told her, “Mom, I’m okay.”It was only as BB was recovering that his mother learned that he had experienced months of symptoms he had rarely mentioned. A few weeks after his surgery, he told his mother he felt much better than he had in years.BB, who will begin his junior year in high school in a few weeks, has resumed playing basketball but currently avoids contact sports and strenuous activity. Because he has had open heart surgery he will need an annual follow-up with a cardiologist for the rest of his life.To Wernovsky, BB’s experience, which has been used as a teaching case for young doctors, is a reminder of the importance of thinking broadly when evaluating symptoms.Shron said she continues to struggle with feelings of guilt that she wasn’t sufficiently assertive in the months before BB’s collapse, which might have led to surgery in less dire circumstances.“I think I should have pushed more,” she said, although Wernovsky and other doctors have assured her there was nothing more she could have done. “Now if he says his toenail hurts, I’m there. He’s here — that’s the best thing.”Submit your solved medical mystery to sandra.boodman@washpost.com. No unsolved cases, please.

{"id": 68, "Title": "Long-term use of acid reflux medications linked to higher dementia risk", "Description": "Long-term use of certain medications to treat heartburn and acid-related disorders is associated with an increased risk of developing dementia, new research shows.The research, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, examined data from more than 5,700 participants who initially did not have dementia and found that those who took proton pump inhibitors for about 4½ years or more had a 33 percent higher risk of developing dementia than those who did not take the medications.The study did not say these medications cause dementia — only that there was an association between using the drugs and a higher risk of developing dementia.The researchers did not find a higher risk of dementia linked to shorter-term use.“Patients taking these medications should talk to their doctor before making any changes to discuss the best treatment for them,” Kamakshi Lakshminarayan, senior author of the study and a professor of neurology at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, wrote in an email. “Stopping these drugs abruptly may result in worse symptoms.”Proton pump inhibitors or PPIs, including Prevacid, Prilosec and Nexium, are used to help manage symptoms of acid reflux and a more serious form called gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, in which the stomach contents move back up into the esophagus. The conditions can cause, among other symptoms, heartburn, nausea and regurgitation, which can lead to more serious complications such as trouble swallowing or bleeding in the digestive tract.People with GERD are also at a slightly increased risk of developing esophageal cancer.Previous studies have shown a possible link between PPI use and a higher risk of stroke, bone fractures and chronic kidney disease, and the researchers wanted to know whether the medications may also be linked to dementia, which affects about one-third of adults age 85 and older.Other studies have looked at PPIs and dementia. Some have found similar results. Others have found no association.In the current observational research, the scientists analyzed data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study gathered from 1987-1989 through 2017, and adjusted for age, race, sex and chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. The average age of participants was 75.The study did not identify which specific proton pump inhibitors the participants took.Participants using over-the-counter medications not prescribed by a health-care provider were excluded.There are several pathways through which PPIs could impact dementia risk, said Pamela Lutsey, a professor of epidemiology and community health at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, who is a co-author of the most recent study.“There is some human evidence that PPI use may predispose to vitamin B12 deficiency, which can be associated with cognitive decline,” she wrote in an email. “Additionally, mice models have suggested that PPI use may impair amyloid metabolism, increasing beta-amyloid levels in the brain. Also, PPI use may result in changes to the gut microbiome that could impact cognitive health.”There may be other variables contributing to dementia risk that were not fully accounted for in the study, research shows.Poor diet and lack of exercise are associated with both acid reflux and dementia, said Gregory Day, a neurologist at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla.Chronic stress may be linked to dementia, research shows.GERD also has been shown to interfere with sleep, and poor sleep is associated with a significantly higher risk of dementia.Studies such as the recent observational study allow us “to have discussions, to be thoughtful about trying to dissect what might be contributing to this risk between a medicine and a cognitive outcome,” Day said. “It doesn’t mean we want all patients throwing these medications in the garbage.”If you are using these medications for ulcers or gastrointestinal problems and stop using them, you could have potentially life-threatening consequences, Day said.People who have concerns about using prescription or over-the-counter PPIs should speak with their health-care providers before stopping these medications, experts say.Clinical guidance from the American Gastroenterological Association on best practices for prescribing or deprescribing PPIs state that although the drugs are generally considered safe, “patients should not use any medication when there is not a reasonable expectation of benefit.”“If taking long term, patients should consult with a primary care physician or gastroenterologist to determine the diagnosis and treatment plan,” Fouad J. Moawad, spokesperson for the American Gastroenterological Association, said in a statement.Moawad also recommended lifestyle modifications, including reducing intake of foods known to trigger symptoms, not eating three hours before going to sleep, elevating the head of the bed and weight loss.“For many patients, an on-demand approach to PPIs may work just fine and potentially carry less risk,” he wrote.Sign up for the Well+Being newsletter, your source of expert advice and simple tips to help you live well every day", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/08/10/acid-reflux-heartburn-medication-dementia/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 10, 2023", "Tag": "Health", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 70, "Title": "Anti-venom shortage for black widow spider bites may be ending", "Description": "Amid the worsening nationwide shortage of an estimated 300 drugs is a longtime one for a rare, but extremely painful, bite — that of the black widow spider.The anti-venom pain-relieving drug Antivenin (Latrodectus mactans) is not commonly used, making it less impactful than the other shortages, yet “it is extremely concerning for someone who would benefit from the treatment,” said Michael Ganio, senior director of pharmacy practice and quality at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. Still, “that doesn’t mean patients should panic,” he said.Merck, the company that makes Antivenin, now says that the drug is available and that it has “taken a number of steps to ensure uninterrupted supply.” Merck sells only between 300 to 800 vials of Antivenin each year.The drug is made by injecting horses with the venom, then extracting antibodies the animals produce, and it should not be given to anyone with an allergy to horses.Black widow spiders — so named because the females sometimes devour their partners after mating — are the creepy stuff of the imagination and pop culture. The menacing hype, however, doesn’t match the reality.Their bite can become extremely painful, but it’s almost never fatal.“Black widows freak people out — they are the queens of spider terror — and an endless source of fascination,” said Kurt Kleinschmidt, a toxicologist and professor of emergency medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center. “But the truth is that while they can cause a lot of misery, they’re very unlikely to kill you.”The black widow spider, distinguished by the red hourglass pattern on its abdomen, is among the most feared venomous spiders in the United States and is found throughout North America, including the Mid-Atlantic region, but especially in the South and West.They most often live in dark places, in woodpiles, under eaves or fences, in garages and outdoor toilets, and in areas with considerable debris. They are considered eco-friendly because they eat pests and other insects that harm plants.“They generally stay outdoors and are very helpful around a community to assist in eating flies and mosquitoes that may be in the environment,” said Richard Clark, director of toxicology at the University of California at San Diego.They usually bite humans in self-defense — when they feel threatened — and leave two characteristic puncture marks in the skin. They secrete a neurotoxin that can produce localized discomfort or can spread to the chest, abdomen, even the entire body, causing more severe pain.There were about 1,000 reported bites in 2021, roughly half of them treated in health-care facilities, according to the annual report of the National Poison Data System. The number increased to 1,137 in 2022, said Shireen Banerji, director of the Rocky Mountain Poison Center and clinical assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Colorado, who took last year’s statistics from the NPDS database.“That number is not huge, but if you are bitten and you are in agony, then the shortage is a real problem,” she said. “We have been challenged with this anti-venom shortage intermittently for years.”Black widow spider bites are infrequent in the area covered by the National Capital Poison Center, which includes D.C., Northern Virginia, and Montgomery and Prince Georges’ counties in Maryland.Since 2013, there have been 139 reported bites, and none required the use of anti-venom, said Kelly Johnson-Arbor, a medical toxicologist and co-director of the center, who stressed their rarity. “In almost 20 years of practicing medical toxicology, I have not taken care of a patient with a black widow spider bite,” she said.Black widow bites can range from uncomfortable to excruciatingly painful, experts said.If someone gets “a lot of venom, they can have a large amount of pain all over their body, in your muscles, your chest and your abdomen,” said Daniel Colby, an emergency medicine physician at UC Davis Health.The symptoms, experts said, can include:Sometimes the pain is misdiagnosed if the patient doesn’t realize they have been bitten, Banerji said.Call the national poison control hotline at 1-800-222-1222 if you are bitten for an assessment of the bite and guidance about what to do and whether to head to an emergency room.“I recommend cleaning the area of the bite, even though infections are not common after their bites,” Clark said. “If there is pain, use over-the-counter analgesics like acetaminophen or ibuprofen.”Don’t try to catch the spider that bit you. “Leave it alone,” Colby said.Pain usually starts within several hours. If the medications don’t help, go to an urgent care or hospital emergency department, Clark said. “For the most part, bites by black widows are not fatal and, even in the worst situations, lead to severe pain for one to two days,” he said.The first line of treatment in a hospital emergency setting should always be pain medication and — if there are muscle spasms — muscle relaxers, experts said. Anti-venom — administered intravenously — should be used only when other medications fail and the pain is unbearable, they said. Even then, clinicians should be very cautious because life-threatening allergic reactions can occur.“Some think you should go straight to the anti-venom because it works very well, and patients look and feel better sooner,” said S. Rutherfoord Rose, professor of emergency medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University and director of the Virginia Poison Center. “But people like me think you can safely manage most cases with muscle relaxers and pain medication, and not give the anti-venom.”Kleinschmidt said he has never used the anti-venom. “People have died after receiving it,” he said. “The question is: what’s more dangerous? The bite or the treatment? In terms of pain, the anti-venom has been helpful, but you generally don’t die from pain.”The reports about the shortage have provoked needless worry, but “for almost all Black Widow” poisonings “in the United States, the risk of anti-venom treatment outweighs the potential benefit most of the time,” said Aaron Skolnik, an emergency room physician at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix.Most hospitals don’t even routinely stock it, although Merck has supplied it in the past in emergencies, said James Leonard, director of clinical services at the Maryland Poison Center and associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy. “We had a patient a few years ago who wasn’t responding, so we asked the company for it and got it fairly quickly,” he said. “We ended up not using it because the patient started getting better — and the company asked for it back.”The drug is safe and effective, but it should be used with care, Clark said. It comes with a skin test for allergies, but it is not “100 percent predictive of a reaction,” he said. Anyone with a horse allergy probably shouldn’t receive it, and “caution should probably also be used before giving it to someone with a history of asthma or allergies to a lot of other environmental things,” he said.Experts suggested these precautions:“We can coexist with them,” he said, “but when you are in their environment — be careful.”An earlier version of this article said that the black widow spider was one of two venomous spiders in the United States. It is among several venomous spiders in the United States.

{"id": 71, "Title": "Do you let your dog lick your face? It can make you sick.", "Description": "Q: My dog often tries to lick my face. Should I allow it? What are the health risks?A: The odds of getting sick from a friendly lick across the face are very low. But the fact is that all dogs will be dogs from time to time — that is, chomp down on goose poop by the sidewalk, lick their nether regions multiple times a day and bring home the odd dead critter. That’s the same mouth you’ll be getting up close and personal with.So there are good reasons the official answer from many experts is “don’t do it,” especially for people who are immunocompromised. Infections acquired from pets are likely underestimated and underrecognized due to general, flu-like symptoms that tend to resolve on their own.Serious bacterial infections from a dog lick have been described in the medical literature. For example, a rare but potentially deadly pathogen — Capnocytophaga canimorsus — can be especially risky for the elderly, those who consume a lot of alcohol or among those who are immunocompromised, such as those without a functional spleen.Capnocytophaga infections are most common after a bite, but can occur without getting bitten.While these risks sound scary, it’s important to remember that they are extremely rare, said Sonya Krishnan, an infectious diseases specialist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.Some researchers have estimated the incidence rate of Capnocytophaga sepsis to be around 0.5-0.7 cases per 1 million people per year. And as Krishnan pointed out, that’s around the same odds as getting struck by lightning.Even if you do follow the expert advice, there may be times when your dog will just go for it mid-snuggle and catch you unaware. To reduce the chance of issues, keep your dog up to date on their vaccines, such as rabies, said Krishnan. (Getting rabies from a dog in the United States is also very unlikely.)“Your skin provides a strong barrier to bacteria entering and causing infection, so there is little risk of infection if a dog licks your skin,” Krishnan said. However, keep your pup away from open wounds, she added, such as pimples and cold sores. It’s also safest to avoid mucous membranes such as your mouth, nose, or eyes.It should go without saying, but getting licked by a stray or unfamiliar dog is a worse idea than letting the family dog lick you.And another concern with bringing your face near any dog is biting.We’d all like to believe our own sweet pupper could never be so guilty. But one study of about 1,300 children treated for dog-bite injuries found that 37 percent of those admitted to the hospital were bitten by a family dog.Most dog bites among older children and adults occur on the hands or lower limbs but can happen more frequently to young children on the head and neck. Because of this, it’s critical not to leave infants or young children unattended with the family dog to avoid injury, even if accidental.If you or your children get bitten by a dog — yours or someone else’s — clean the area thoroughly and immediately call your doctor. In certain cases, they may prescribe prophylactic antibiotics or, with serious injuries, need to repair the wound surgically.None of this is to say that you shouldn’t fully bask in the joys of loving your dog. Many studies have found that living with a dog has health benefits, including alleviating loneliness and enforcing exercise through daily walks. For many people, dogs are what got us through the pandemic amid so much pain and loss — myself included.Possible immune protection may be especially strong in childhood, as studies have shown that babies living with dogs in the home are less likely to develop food allergies and respiratory symptoms and infections.Plus, when we bond with our dogs, the owner and the pet both get a boost of oxytocin — the “love hormone.” This can occur after petting or talking to our dogs. No licking required.Make sure you take care of your pet as an extension of taking care of your own health. Even the sprightliest pup needs preventive health screens just like a human does: After all, our states of well-being are connected. It’s important to get your dog’s stool tested regularly, give them an anti-parasitic medication monthly and familiarize them with having their teeth brushed regularly with some canine toothpaste. If you have any concerns or questions, check in with your veterinarian.Meet the doctor: Trisha Pasricha is a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and a medical journalist.Ask a Doctor: Got a health question?

{"id": 72, "Title": "Nose picking linked to higher risk of covid, study shows", "Description": "Habitual nose picking is associated with an increased risk of contracting the coronavirus, researchers in the Netherlands found.A new study, published Wednesday in PLOS ONE, showed that nearly 85 percent of 219 health-care workers surveyed reported picking their noses with varying frequencies — monthly, weekly or daily. Of those, about 17 percent contracted the coronavirus, compared with about 6 percent of those who said they did not engage in the activity. The risk was relatively the same for all nose pickers, the researchers said, regardless of how often they did it.The researchers had studied the increased risk of coronavirus contraction among health-care workers in 2020 and wanted to know what may have led to it. In the recent study, they decided to look at behaviors that conflict with health guidelines — wearing beards, biting nails and picking schnozzles.“It was quite funny to investigate,” said Jonne J. Sikkens, an internal medicine specialist and clinical epidemiologist at Amsterdam University Medical Centers, who led the study. On a more serious note, “it was surprising how it may affect transmission,” he said.The findings do not prove that those who stick their fingers in their nostrils are more likely to contract the coronavirus, but “we need to be more aware of it in the workplace to avoid doing it,” Sikkens said.Our noses suck in air and the organisms floating in it, making the nose one of the main entry points for bacteria and viruses. The dark, moist nooks and crannies of the nasal cavities are an ideal environment for germs such as the coronavirus.The coronavirus is spread primarily through respiratory droplets and particles that are inhaled. The virus can also land on surfaces or faces, and touching the eyes, mouth or nose after touching parts of the face or a surface that has been contaminated increases the risk of introducing it into the body, experts say.“It makes sense that touching your nose with your hands — because our hands touch so many surfaces — is a way to move infectious agents from one surface to another, and from one person to another,” said Stuart Ray, a professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University, who was not involved in the study.The mucosa or mucous membrane that lines our nasal cavities, however, offers protection. The membrane is sticky, allowing it to trap the pathogens so the immune system can attack them before they start to replicate, experts say. When this protective lining is damaged, by nose picking, for instance, it compromises its abilities.“If you scratch your mucosa, the stuff that’s trapped in that mucus gets access to the bloodstream,” Ray said.One study found that nose pickers were significantly more likely than non-nose pickers to carry staph infection in their nasal passages.People touch their faces for many reasons such as to communicate and self-soothe. Some of these actions can be involuntary, such as rubbing their forehead, or learned, such as chewing on their fingernails, said Zach Sikora, a licensed clinical psychologist with Northwestern Medicine Regional Medical Group.During the pandemic, research showed that even medical and dental students touched their faces. One study showed that a group of medical students touched their faces, on average, 23 times per hour — and 44 percent of those touches involved contact with the eyes, mouth or nose.“Humans need to pacify,” said Joe Navarro, an expert on nonverbal communication and body language, and the author of “What Every Body is Saying.” “We can’t just tell the brain to self-soothe; we physically have to do it. It begins in the womb with self-touching, with thumb-sucking. And as we become adults, we do a lot of nose touching.”The trigeminal or fifth cranial nerve carries sensory signals from the face, including the jaw, eyelids and nose, to the brainstem, allowing people to feel touch, temperature and pain. Stimulating the nerve can help self-soothe, Navarro said.“A lot of people who are under stress, they’ll bite their lip, they’ll shut their eyes really tight, or they’ll grab their nose — the tip of the nose, in particular — and touch it,” he said.To curb the spread of disease, medical experts suggest people try to keep their hands away from their faces. Habits can be hard to break, though, and some recommend enlisting family members and close friends to discreetly call attention to it.Try to replace face-touching with less risky behaviors — massage the back of your neck, rub your hands together or carry a trinket such as a small stone or a key to fiddle with.Or implement barriers such as gloves or masks to dissuade face-touching.“If I have a mask on, I’m not going to be able to pick my nose or bite my nails, which is my issue,” said Scott C. Roberts, assistant professor of infectious diseases at Yale School of Medicine. “But everyone needs to find what works for them.”For those who cannot help but touch their faces, experts advise taking precautions to reduce the risk of getting and transmitting disease. Wash your hands frequently or, in a pinch, use hand sanitizer to keep them clean, particularly in the cold and flu season.The study does not definitively show that nose picking increases the risk of contracting the coronavirus. With such studies, experts say, it is difficult to disentangle behaviors. For instance, it is not known whether those who denied picking their noses and stayed healthier were more careful overall — more likely to wear masks, wash their hands and distance themselves from others.“It brings forward an interesting idea, but I’m not sure that we can say definitively that this is such an important risk factor for covid acquisition,” said Jorge Salinas, a hospital epidemiologist at Stanford University, who was not involved in the study.The researchers looked at other potential risk factors, too. About 33 percent of respondents reported biting their nails, and 31 percent of men reported having a beard, which can interfere with proper mask fit. There was no significant association between these factors and incidence of covid, the researchers said.On the other hand, wearing glasses may have a small protective effect, but this is less robust, said Ayesha Lavell, co-author of the study and an internal medicine resident at Amsterdam University Medical Centers.Sign up for the Well+Being newsletter, your source of expert advice and simple tips to help you live well every day", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/08/02/nose-picking-covid-research/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 2, 2023", "Tag": "Health", "Keywords": "Nose picking, coronavirus, transmission."}
{"id": 73, "Title": "This embarrassing bathroom accident is more common than you think", "Description": "Q: I have embarrassing leakage of stool from time to time. Is this common? Is there any way to stop it?A: People are often so embarrassed to talk about this topic that you’d think no one in their adult lives has pooped their pants — or, as we say in medicine, experienced accidental bowel leakage or fecal incontinence.It’s more common than you think: One study based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found fecal incontinence affects about 8 percent of U.S. adults.Since people often don’t bring it up on their own, I’ve made it a point to ask my patients directly about it because effective treatments are available.Increasing fiber in the diet is one of the first things I recommend. Three of my colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital were part of a group that researched this: In a study involving about 60,000 older women, they found that a high-fiber diet was associated with a reduced risk of fecal incontinence.It sounds counterintuitive, but fiber is useful to bulk up looser stool and promote water absorption by the colon. It’s also helpful for constipation, which is a common cause of fecal incontinence due to overflow diarrhea.An analysis of the same cohort also found that eating more pro-inflammatory foods, such as processed meats or sugary sodas, was associated with a higher risk of fecal incontinence. The authors hypothesized that pro-inflammatory foods could have negative interactions with the gut microbiome and diminish the function of the muscles and nerves of the pelvic floor.Of everything you’ve heard about these foods, this is quite a motivating reason to minimize eating them.Beyond constipation, fecal incontinence can be caused by common underlying issues such as diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease and lactose intolerance. It can also be a sign of certain health conditions, like diabetes and even neurological problems.But it’s possible there’s no underlying “diagnosis” driving the fecal incontinence. Sometimes the triggers are things we’re doing inadvertently — like side effects of medications (including antibiotics) or dietary aggravators like artificial sweeteners that lead to looser, more urgent stool that is hard to control.The odds of having accidental bowel leakage increase as you age. Some of that risk is related to muscular and neurological changes that occur with aging that make it harder to notice when stool is present and to keep it contained. Among the elderly, dementia and poor mobility increase the chances of experiencing fecal incontinence, while higher levels of physical activity can lower them.All this said, I wouldn’t consider frequent fecal incontinence “normal,” no matter your age.There has been a lot of back and forth in medical literature about whether childbirth-related injuries raise your risk, but several studies have shown fecal incontinence actually affects men and women similarly.It’s a bit confusing, because we know women are more likely than men to seek care for their bowel leakage from a physician, and some women, especially those with tearing or requiring forceps for delivery, do experience it in the first few months following childbirth. However, the data are not clear that childbirth-related injuries could lead to fecal incontinence 20 or 30 years later.Menopausal hormone therapy has been shown to modestly increase the risk of fecal incontinence with higher chances the longer you’re on therapy, potentially due to the effect of estrogens on the pelvic floor. (My colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital also formed part of this research group.)When a patient comes to me about this, I ask them questions about their pattern of incontinence, which can shed light on two common reasons this happens: problems with the muscles and nerves of the pelvic floor and problems with stool quality.Does your bowel leakage happen passively, sometimes without you even realizing it? That could suggest a pelvic floor issue that could be treated by a specialist.Does it occur with a sense of urgency, feeling like you need the bathroom right now, but then not making to it in time? That could be related to a bowel disturbance like diarrhea that may respond to medication.Depending on your history, your physician may want to pursue additional testing for disorders that can change your stool quality and raise the risk of incontinence. They may also do a physical exam or specialized tests like anorectal manometry or an MRI exam to better assess your pelvic floor.Your doctor may identify other issues with the pelvic floor leading to your leakage such as a prolapse, which may need surgery to fix. Sometimes, dysfunction of the pelvic floor muscles may benefit from biofeedback, a specialized physical therapy that involves inserting a probe inside the anal canal and analyzing how the pelvic muscles move during defecation.I know, I know. But pelvic floor physical therapy is more weird than it is uncomfortable — and it works well!The social consequences of fecal incontinence can be devastating. It’s why initiating a conversation about it is the hardest — but most important — step toward not just figuring out what’s going on, but also improving your quality of life.Meet the doctor: Trisha S.

{"id": 75, "Title": "Extreme heat and pollution can double the risk of a fatal heart attack", "Description": "Exposure to extreme temperatures combined with suffocating air pollution can double the risk of dying from a heart attack, according to Chinese researchers who analyzed more than 200,000 cardiac deaths in China between 2015 and 2020.Experts, who already believe that prolonged heat waves, cold snaps and polluted air are bad for the heart, said the study, published Monday in the journal Circulation, further strengthens the relationship by connecting it to the risk of cardiac death.“As far as I am aware, this is one of the first studies that looks at death from heart attack as the end result of this type of exposure, and it does not surprise me,” said Catharina Giudice, an emergency medicine physician and a fellow at the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study.“We’re seeing record-breaking heat after record-breaking heat year after year,” she said. “It’s getting hotter, lasting longer and happening more frequently. Heat makes cardiovascular disease worse. Pollution makes it worse. The two together are worse than each one independently.”Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, killing about 695,000 Americans in 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The study, funded by China’s Ministry of Science and Technology, comes against a backdrop of prolonged and sweltering record-setting heat that has been smothering the United States and other countries, combined with industrial and wildfire air pollution, all fueled by a warming planet.The dangerous health effects of climate change are well documented, including threats from the spread of infectious diseases, food insecurity, the worsening of seasonal allergies, the risk of dementia and the deadly effects of heat waves, floods, drought and wildfire smoke. Existing evidence also suggests that climate change-induced stress is tied to heart problems. Several studies by cardiologists in New Orleans, for example, found a dramatic jump in the number of heart attacks in the years following the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina.(China and the United States are the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases, the pollutants that drive climate change.)The researchers examined the effects of extreme temperatures with and without high levels of fine particulate pollution on 202,678 heart attack deaths between 2015 and 2020 that occurred in Jiangsu province, a region with four distinct seasons and a wide range of temperatures and fine particulate pollution levels.They found that days with extreme heat, extreme cold or high levels of fine particulate matter air pollution were significantly associated with the risk of death from a heart attack, especially for women and older adults, those with an average age of about 77.1/2The greatest increases occurred on days with both extreme heat and high levels of PM2.5 (Particulate Matter), which are particles less than 2.5 microns in width, (for comparison, the width of a human hair is 50 to 100 microns) estimating that up to 2.8 percent of the heart attack deaths were related to the combination of extreme temperatures and high levels of fine particulate pollution of more than 37.5 micrograms per cubic meter. (A microgram is a unit of mass equal to one-millionth of a gram.) They also found that heat waves interact synergistically with the fine particles, while cold spells do not.Inhaling these microscopic particles — the result of fuel combustion from cars and factories, and wildfire smoke — deep into the lungs can irritate them and the blood vessels around the heart. Research has linked their exposure to heart disease, stroke and other health issues, including dementia. The World Health Organization’s target for average annual exposure to fine particulate pollution level is no more than 5 micrograms per cubic meter and no more than 15 micrograms per cubic meter for more than three to four days per year.Compared with control days, the risk of a fatal heart attack was 18 percent higher during two-day heat waves with heat ranging from 82.6 to 97.9 degrees Fahrenheit, and 74 percent higher during four-day heat waves with temperatures between 94.8 and 109.4 degrees Fahrenheit. The risk was 4 percent higher during two-day cold snaps with temperatures between 33.3 to 40.5 degrees Fahrenheit, and 12 percent higher during three-day cold snaps of 27 to 37.2 degrees Fahrenheit.The researchers measured extreme temperatures according to the daily heat index for an area, which records the combined effect of both heat and humidity, and also evaluated the length and severity of heat waves and cold snaps.They compared heart attack deaths or “case days” with control days on the same day of the week in the same month — if a death occurred on a Wednesday, all other Wednesdays in the same month were regarded as control days. Days with an average level of fine particulate matter above 37.5 micrograms per cubic meter were considered high air pollution days.“It’s pretty amazing that they started seeing these increases with temperatures over 90 degrees,” said Mark Link, a professor of internal medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, and a member of its cardiology division, who was not part of the study. “In Dallas, we would call 90 degrees a cool day, but that’s when they saw mortality start to increase — and the combination of high heat and pollution was the deadliest. It’s pretty remarkable when you think about what’s happening down here now, where the average high is 102 or 103 degrees.”On such days, “emergency visits for cardiac issues and everything else are up,” he said.Yuewei Liu, associate professor of epidemiology in the School of Public Health at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China, and the study’s senior author, said it was still unknown how these exposures trigger a greater risk of dying of a heart attack. Such questions remain “a great public health challenge due to its substantial disease burden worldwide,” he said.Health-care professionals typically urge lifestyle modifications to prevent heart disease, such as avoiding or quitting smoking; controlling hypertension, high cholesterol and diabetes; losing weight; and exercising. Now, these may not be enough, experts said.This study demonstrates “we cannot ignore the environment around us,” said Hitinder Gurm, an interventional cardiologist and chief medical officer at the University of Michigan, who was not part of the study but whose research has focused on temperature deviations and the risk of heart attacks. “Air pollution and extreme weather are emerging as important cardiac risk factors and require both individual and community level interventions.”During heat waves and high pollution days, experts recommend that people:Gurm noted that most heart attacks still occur in people with risk factors, but said additional measures were necessary to “safeguard the most vulnerable from exposure to severe weather conditions and poor air quality.”Sign up for the Well+Being newsletter, your source of expert advice and simple tips to help you live well every day", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/07/27/extreme-heat-pollution-heart-attack-risk/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "July 27, 2023", "Tag": "Health", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 76, "Title": "Does acupuncture work for chronic pain? Here’s what the science says.", "Description": "Q: I’ve tried a lot of medicines for my chronic pain and nothing works. Should I try acupuncture?A: Critics once dismissed the benefits of acupuncture as purely a placebo effect, a notion that still lingers among a portion of the public. But research has found a benefit for certain conditions, including chronic pain.The data is so promising that, in 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services started covering acupuncture therapy for chronic low back pain. Clinical trials over the past several decades have suggested acupuncture may be a beneficial treatment for other conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and constipation.To determine if acupuncture really works, researchers have compared it to “sham” acupuncture.Acupuncture is a treatment composed of activating specific locations — or acupoints — on the body, commonly with fine needles. In traditional East Asian medicine, activating acupoints is thought to help restore the flow of chi, the body’s vital energy.In sham acupuncture, the acupuncturist inserts needles, but deliberately avoids established acupoints. It’s not a perfect double-blind system, because trained acupuncturists know they’re administering a sham.From the patient’s perspective, however, the experience is essentially the same. And if the benefits of acupuncture were entirely due to a placebo effect, the sham and the real thing would produce similar results.In some cases, they don’t.A 2018 meta-analysis of over 20,000 patients in 39 high-quality randomized controlled trials found that acupuncture was superior to both sham and no acupuncture for back or neck pain, osteoarthritis, headaches and shoulder pain. These outcomes mostly persisted over time — even after 12 months of receiving treatment.But it isn’t a magic cure-all. Like any treatment, it may not be a good fit for everyone. Though it’s popular among people undergoing in vitro fertilization treatments, for example, research has shown it does not improve fertility.Some skepticism persists over a lack of explanation from a Western medicine perspective of how acupuncture works. But scientists have started to unlock the answer: The brain.“People talk about psychedelics reshaping the nervous system. Acupuncture kind of does the same thing,” said Richard Harris, a professor and endowed chair of the University of California, Irvine Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute.His group conducted a series of analyses on acupuncture among chronic pain patients. They found that acupuncture — but not sham — changed brain activity in terms of activating the receptors that bind opioids, which help control pain in the body. Electroacupuncture, in which the needles are stimulated with minor electrical currents, also impacted how different areas of the brain were connected, essentially rewiring the brain’s pain network.Consider this: In a 2017 study of 80 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, scientists discovered that electroacupuncture of the afflicted wrist was as effective in relieving symptoms as acupuncture at the opposite ankle.How could that be?Subjective recovery aside, both groups had improvement in how well the median nerve of the wrist could transmit electrical signals — which didn’t happen to those who got sham acupuncture. This would suggest that acupuncture can act locally where the needle is placed, but also may have the ability to act on parts of the body nowhere near that spot.One way this could occur is via the central nervous system. So scientists looked at the subjects’ brains using functional MRI imaging. They found that needling at the wrist and ankle both resulted in significant changes to how stimulation to the fingers was mapped onto the cerebral cortex.More research is needed to further uncover the ways acupuncture influences the body, but studies have provided convincing evidence that it’s far more than just a placebo effect.The World Health Organization consensus recognizes 361 standardized acupoints on the human body. Acupoints appear to respond to varied stimulation, such as from pressure, heat and electricity.There’s still a lot we don’t know about how acupoints work. Some studies have shown that traditional acupoints may have a high density of nerve endings and mast cells. Stimulating these areas may lead to the release of chemicals in the body (such as hormones) and ultimately impact the brain.Piecing together what defines an acupoint, how they relate to each other and their physiological importance is a critical area of research funded by the National Institutes of Health.If you’re considering acupuncture, talk to your physician about your options, and ask them about finding a qualified acupuncturist in your area.Acupuncture is generally considered safe when done by a well-trained practitioner. Serious complications and fatalities related to it are exceedingly rare. Fainting or pain at the site of needle insertion are also infrequent.The risks are not zero, but they can be lower than those associated with some pain medications.Some people in the United States are biased against treatments not based in Western medicine.

{"id": 78, "Title": "Florida kept disabled kids in institutions. A judge is sending them home.", "Description": "Cayden Armour has lived most of his life in a Florida nursing home, where his father said the disabled 9-year-old was often left alone in his room, sitting in soiled diapers for hours.Cayden, who has multiple medical complications after nearly drowning as an infant, is one of many children in Florida who have been separated from their families and institutionalized rather than getting state-provided at-home care.Now, a federal judge has ruled that Florida has been unlawfully segregating children with complex medical needs and putting other disabled children at risk of unnecessary institutionalization. The judge, who issued the ruling Friday, said that by failing to provide Medicaid services that would pay for private nursing care and allow children to live in home settings, the state was in violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA).In court records and interviews with The Washington Post, parents of disabled children described a broken system in which they often felt forced to send their children to nursing homes because they couldn’t get reliable state-provided home care. Once institutionalized, the children were neglected; frequently hospitalized with infections; and left in soiled diapers for hours, crying and depressed, their families told The Post.Some children were left alone all day with nothing to do but watch TV or were trapped in cribs, according to the judge’s ruling. Parents who wanted to bring their children home described feeling thwarted by the nursing homes, which are paid by the state for each child in their care.In his decision, U.S. District Court Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks called the difficulties faced by children and parents “heart wrenching,” and wrote that “any family who wants to care for their child at home should be able to do so.”Children with disabilities typically are eligible for Medicaid services, which can be provided in a home setting or an institution. The state makes decisions about who qualifies and is responsible for paying for the services.The cost of home health care can be cheaper than institutionalized care, but Florida has increased funding for nursing facility services while reducing funding for home- and community-based services, court documents show.“The tragedy is that the State of Florida has programs and dedicated resources that could help these families,” Middlebrooks wrote.The ruling, prompted by a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department in 2013, could have sweeping implications for thousands of people across the country who need these Medicaid services to live in their homes or communities, a group that includes adults with disabilities and older people, along with disabled children and their families.Florida is just one of many states across the country where experts say children with disabilities are being unnecessarily institutionalized rather than supported in home settings. Recently, the department has said other states, including Alaska, Maine and Nevada, also are violating the ADA in this way.The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, which is responsible for running the state’s Medicaid program, declined requests for an interview.In a statement, the agency said, “The court’s conclusion that the State’s actions or omissions force children to live in nursing homes against their parent’s wishes is unsupported and refuted by the evidence presented at trial.”The agency also said it would seek to stay the judge’s orders. The state filed a notice of appeal for the case Monday.The Florida Department of Health and other witnesses for the state of Florida declined to comment on the case.The ruling directly affects an estimated 140 children in Florida nursing homes and more than 1,800 children at risk of being institutionalized because they don’t have reliable access to home-care services. Disability advocates and legal experts say the case is expected to set a precedent by clarifying what states must do to comply with the ADA, which protects the rights of people with disabilities to live in the most integrated setting possible. The ruling makes clear that states can be held accountable for the way they administer home- and community-based services, legal experts said.“In many respects, this ruling is groundbreaking,” said Kristen Clarke, the assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department. “Our hope is that this ruling will stand as a model for other states across the country and make clear and explain their obligations under the law.”Conlan Armour, Cayden’s father and a witness in the lawsuit, tried for the past five years to remove his son from Kidz Korner, a facility in Plantation, Fla., which was paid by Medicaid to care for Cayden.When Cayden first became disabled, hospital staff said the family’s only option was to place him in institutional care, according to interviews and trial testimony.Armour visited Cayden nearly every day, he said, and at the end of some visits, Cayden cried. Cayden entered Kidz Korner able to breathe on his own, but today requires a ventilator after being hospitalized for pneumonia while at the facility.But when Armour, 39, met his now-fiancée, Dorothy Newton, 36, she researched the issue and learned that the family had the option to bring Cayden home and get Medicaid-funded home-care services.Armour said the couple repeatedly requested to bring Cayden home, but Kidz Korner staff told them their home was not big enough. Armour said they were also told by Kidz Korner they needed to complete training to provide Cayden’s medical care, but the facility staff failed to show up for training or rescheduled it. (In his ruling, the judge said the facility should not have created these barriers.)“They try to almost discourage you from bringing the child home,” Armour said in an interview.Kidz Korner did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Armour said it wasn’t until he became a witness in the lawsuit that the nursing facility finally gave him training and approved Cayden to go home. In June, Cayden started living with his father, Newton and his 18-month old sister, Devi, in Miramar, Fla.Since getting home, he has become more active and is smiling and attempting to talk more, Armour said. His father hopes that this ruling will help other families.“Whether it’s my child or somebody else’s child, we want change,” Armour said.Mary Ehlenbach, the medical director of the Pediatric Complex Care Program at the University of Wisconsin, who interviewed 44 families with institutionalized children and submitted a report on her findings for the case, said that many families were told incorrectly that their children were medically unfit to live at home or that the family wasn’t eligible to bring their child home because of the size of their house.“Efforts to reunify families with their children were nothing short of abysmal on the part of these facilities,” said Ehlenbach, an expert witness in the case. “Facilities have an interest in keeping the children and keeping the facility full. They get reimbursed at a remarkably high rate.”As of October 2021, the latest data available, the state paid nursing facilities a supplemental payment of $344.26 per day for each medically fragile child. When combined with the baseline payment that facilities receive, this meant that some institutions received about $600 or more a day to care for these children, according to experts familiar with the case.In a report submitted to the court, Ehlenbach said that the vast majority of the families she interviewed would have preferred for their children to live outside a nursing home setting if appropriate supports and services were available.Nationally, about 1.9 million people live in long-term care institutions. It’s unclear how many of them are children, but disability advocates have lauded this ruling as a victory for anyone living in an institutionalized setting.They believe the ruling could pressure other states to invest more in home- and community-based services provided through Medicaid. In 2021, 656,000 people around the country were on waiting lists to simply determine whether they qualify for these services. But even after getting approved, many people say they still can’t get this type of at-home nursing care.“We’re still seeing a lot of unnecessary institutionalizations of people with disabilities and a bias toward institutionalization,” said Shira Wakschlag, the senior director of legal advocacy and general counsel for the Arc of the United States, which serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.The state of Florida argued at the trial that many of the children living in institutions were too fragile to live at home or in their communities. One of the state’s expert witnesses, Allan Greissman, a critical care pediatrician at Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital, described many children as being in a “persistent vegetative state” or “neurologically devastated,” and suggested that they would derive no benefit from being at home.Ehlenbach’s report, however, found that all of the children could be considered medically appropriate to receive care at home. It also found that they had a wide range of functional states and even those with severe neurological disabilities would benefit from living in a home setting.“Their medical and care needs can be met (and may be better met) outside of a skilled nursing facility with appropriate home- and community-based services,” the report stated.In reviewing medical records of about 140 institutionalized children, physicians found evidence of a number of medical complications such as pressure wounds and infections — some of which led children to become dependent on ventilators.At home, Dalton began walking and talking and was able to be weaned off a ventilator. He loves Spider-Man and has started learning to read and write, she said.The gaps in his at-home nursing care, though, have taken a toll on Patten, a single mother who estimates that she misses 30 to 40 days of work each year because she can’t get caregivers.“It’s overwhelming,” she said. “You’re sleep deprived, you’re everything deprived.”Advocates say that the timing of this ruling is especially important as the pandemic has exacerbated existing care provider shortages and exposed the health-care risks of living in a congregate group setting.One of the key drivers behind the shortage of caregivers is the low rate of reimbursement most states give to pay these workers — nationally, the average pay for home health aides is around $14 an hour.In the Florida ruling, the judge said that even in the face of worker shortages, states still have a responsibility to provide home- and community-based services. Judge Middlebrooks wrote that the state could take steps to improve its services, such as raising wages to attract more workers to the profession.Eve Harris, 57, of Plantation, said she was forced to institutionalize her 16-year old grandson, Jeffery Herrion, for whom she is the legal guardian, because home caregivers increasingly didn’t show up during the pandemic. Herrion, who is blind, has cerebral palsy and other complex medical issues requiring him to use a ventilator, wheelchair and feeding pump.A previous version of this article misstated the name of Conlan Armour’s fiancée. She is Dorothy Newton, not Dorothy Newtown. The story also said care facilities received $344.26 per child per day from the state. This amount is a supplemental payment, and the entire payment can reach about $600 or more per child per day.

{"id": 79, "Title": "Hearing aids may cut risk of cognitive decline by nearly half", "Description": "Older adults at greater risk for dementia may be able to protect themselves against cognitive decline by using hearing aids, new research shows.A study published Monday in the Lancet found that the use of hearing aids can reduce the risk of cognitive decline by about half — 48 percent — for adults with more risk factors for dementia, such as elevated blood pressure, higher rates of diabetes, lower education and income, and those living alone. The study was presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Amsterdam.“It came as a surprise in a good way, seeing that hearing intervention had such a large effect on reducing cognitive decline,” said Frank Lin, professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health, who was lead author of the study. “It really draws attention to the fact that hearing is really important. And, in many cases, people don’t realize whether or not they have hearing loss, so clearly a first step is getting your hearing checked if you don’t know where your hearing level is.”Hearing loss is common worldwide, but is often untreated, especially in lower- and middle-income countries. Nearly 2.5 billion people are expected to have some hearing loss, and at least 700 million people will require help with their hearing by 2050, according to the World Health Organization.Age-related hearing loss nearly doubles the risk for dementia, a 2020 report in Lancet showed, accounting for more than 8 percent of all dementia cases — 800,000 of the nearly 10 million new cases of dementia diagnosed every year. Hearing treatment, though, is now more accessible, as hearing aids are available over-the-counter in the United States.Over a three-year period, the randomized controlled trial studied nearly 1,000 older adults, ages 70 to 84, in four sites in the United States. The participants included older adults in an ongoing study of cardiovascular health — Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) — and others who were healthier than the ARIC adults; both groups were from the same communities at each site.When the two groups were combined, use of hearing aids was shown to have no significant effect on slowing cognitive changes. When the group at higher risk of dementia, the ARIC group, was analyzed separately, however, researchers found that hearing intervention — counseling with an audiologist and use of hearing aids — had a significant impact on reducing cognitive decline. Those considered at high risk for dementia were older and had lower cognitive scores, among other factors.When the groups were combined, the slower rate of cognitive decline experienced by the healthier participants may have limited any effect of hearing aids, the researchers suggested.Whether hearing treatment reduces the risk of developing dementia in the long term is still unknown. “That’s the next big question — and something we can’t answer yet,” said Lin, who is also director of the Cochlear Center for Hearing and Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. He said he and his colleagues are planning a long-term follow-up study to attempt to answer that question.There have many studies over the past decade to try to determine why people with hearing loss tend to have worse cognition, said Justin S. Golub, an associate professor of otolaryngology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. One theory is that it requires a lot of effort for people with hearing loss to understand what others are saying — and that necessary brainpower leaves fewer cognitive resources to process the meaning of what was heard, he said.Another theory relates to brain structure. Research has shown that the temporal lobe of people with hearing loss tends to shrink quicker because it is not receiving as much auditory input from the inner ear. The temporal lobe is connected to other parts of the brain, and “that could have cascading influences on brain structure and function,” said Golub, who was not part of the Lancet study.A third theory is that people with hearing loss tend to be less social and, as a result, have less cognitive stimulation, he said.There have been smaller clinical trials attempting to show that people who wear hearing aids tend to have better cognition, but there has never been a large-scale study looking at the long-term cognitive effects of wearing a hearing aid until now, Golub said.“This is truly unique, truly groundbreaking,” he said.Sign up for the Well+Being newsletter, your source of expert advice and simple tips to help you live well every day", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/07/19/hearing-loss-hearing-aids-dementia-study/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "July 19, 2023", "Tag": "Health", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 80, "Title": "How to get rid of leg cramps? Try pickle juice.", "Description": "Q: I often have leg cramps. What causes them, and what can I do to alleviate them?A: Leg cramps can happen to anyone — often in the middle of the night without warning or around the time of exercise — and doctors don’t usually know why.We do know muscle cramps occur more frequently among the elderly and among athletes, during pregnancy and dialysis, and in those with certain health conditions such as diabetes, cirrhosis or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. If you’re experiencing cramps often, be sure to check with your doctor to rule out any concerns.Leg cramps seem to peak in the midsummer and decrease in the winter, according to one study. Cramping among athletes also tends to increase during periods of hot weather, but it seems these cramps aren’t related to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances from sweating, as some have thought.Evidence on how best to treat leg cramps is weak. But after reviewing the state of the medical literature, I often recommend trying two simple solutions: gently stretch the muscle or take a sip of pickle juice.Yep, pickle juice.For cramping, athletes have long sworn by pickle juice (strained from jars of dill or kosher pickles) and other acidic substances such as mustard or apple cider vinegar.Experimental data in healthy college-aged men suggests that pickle juice inhibits muscle cramps through a reflex involving a nerve in our throats. It’s why a tablespoon of pickle brine hitting the back of the throat seemed to bring relief within seconds.Pickle juice may also work for cramps that aren’t induced by exercise. A randomized controlled trial published last year found that a sip of pickle juice reduced muscle cramp intensity in patients with cirrhosis.Researchers believe this improvement is due to a similar reflex that occurs almost immediately, rather than by how pickle juice is metabolized by the gut.More rigorous research is needed on pickle juice’s effect on muscle cramps. And this strategy might be less helpful for people whose leg cramps are rare or disappear on their own too quickly to justify keeping pickle juice handy. But it’s safe and cheap enough that I’d feel comfortable recommending it to anyone.Remember: No need to overdo it.“A sip is all it takes. We’re not telling people to chug pickle juice,” said Elliot Tapper, a hepatologist at the University of Michigan and the 2022 study’s lead author.Doctors often suggest a trial-and-error approach for preventing leg cramps, including a few weeks of daily calf and hamstring stretching (which might reduce the severity, although not necessarily the frequency of nocturnal leg cramps), a stint of magnesium (although a recent meta-analysis found that this probably does very little) or a sprinkle of vitamin B complex (which showed promise in a small study from the 1990s).Your physician may also try swapping out any medications that are implicated in cramping, including long-acting beta-agonists like those found in Advair or Symbicort and diuretics like spironolactone.The funny thing here is that there’s a chance one of these will work — despite much of the data screaming that it shouldn’t. Case in point: A 2017 double-blind randomized controlled trial published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that taking magnesium oxide for a month reduced the number of night leg cramps by about three times per week. That’s a huge win to go from, say, having a cramp wake you up every single night to having one every other night instead.Guess what, though? The placebo did the same thing.Studies have also suggested quinine can reduce the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps. But because of serious safety issues associated with its use, including an increased risk of death, quinine for nocturnal leg cramps is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.Some might make the logical leap to propose a nightly gin and tonic to ease cramping. But prescribed doses of quinine are around 300 mg, and the FDA restricts the amount of quinine in tonic water to 83 mg per liter — far more than you’d get from a standard cocktail.Considering leg cramps are associated with alcohol consumption, I’d say we all just hold our charley horses on that idea.Supplements are popular for all kinds of reasons, including when evidence-based medicine doesn’t provide great solutions. Don’t hide what supplements you’re taking from your doctor, even if you think they won’t “approve.” I’d always rather know and work with you to find safe choices. Many supplements interact with common prescriptions, and some may have unintended — and potentially harmful — effects.Meet the doctor: Trisha S.

{"id": 81, "Title": "Ask a Doctor: Why is it so hard to find my veins for blood tests?", "Description": "Q: I hate getting my blood drawn. It’s always hard to find my veins. Are there any ways to make it less awful?A: Needles can hurt and having to be poked multiple times to find the vein is a special form of torture.Hydrating the day before a blood draw and keeping your arms warm as you head into the lab can make for a smoother experience. Staying calm is also important, though that’s easier said than done. Priming your nerves — and your veins — can help make a difference.Hydrate in advance: Experts usually recommend to start hydrating the day before you know you’ll go in. The goal isn’t to drink excessively, but to ensure you’re not dehydrated, which can decrease blood volume. Water is generally allowed even when the bloodwork is supposed to be done “fasting,” but make sure to check with your medical provider beforehand.Warm up your arms: Wearing long sleeves that you can roll up is a good idea, but I suggest going a step further: Bring some hand warmers and rub them up and down your arms to dilate the veins before the stick. You can also try running your forearms under warm water in a bathroom or ask if the lab has a hot towel you wrap around them.Speak up about your veins: Certain people, especially those who are elderly or chronically ill, have “rolling veins” — meaning the collagen in tissues that anchor veins in place are weakened, causing the vessels to “roll” when approached by a needle. Tell the technician if that sounds like you. Some facilities might have technicians who are more accustomed to patients with difficult-to-find veins or use tools like vein finders or ultrasounds that can help identify a good vessel. If the technician got a needle in easily, ask them which vein they used so you’ll know for the future.There is nothing worse than undergoing a needle-stick only to discover the sample “hemolyzed,” meaning the blood cells burst, rendering testing inaccurate. It often happens because of how the tube is handled after the blood is drawn, but sticking a larger vein — like from the antecubital fossa in the crook of your elbow — has been shown to reduce the risk of hemolysis, while having the tourniquet on for longer than a minute raises those odds.Calm yourself with a breathing exercise: Make sure you aren’t holding your breath. Instead, take deep breaths rising from your stomach, rather than your chest. If that’s not for you, try distracting yourself by scrolling through TikTok or chatting with the technician. Some people deliberately pinch the opposite side of the body to distract their brains while the needle goes in, but if this will only stress you out further, I wouldn’t advise it.Press on the bandage: To prevent bruising, hold pressure over the dressing for a few minutes — not seconds — after the technician is done. Avoid carrying anything very heavy with that arm for an hour or two afterward.Don’t hesitate to speak up if you’re feeling very nervous or faint before, during or after a blood test. Be sure to inform the technician if you’ve fainted due to bloodwork in the past. They may go straight to using a butterfly needle, which is thinner than the standard variety and tends to hurt less (though it’ll take longer to get your blood drawn). They can also bring in backup or have you recline during the needle-stick to protect you from grabbing some floor.So why does this happen? Fainting at the sight of blood is thought to be caused by the vagus nerve, which is responsible for calming the body and aiding in digestion. When it goes overboard, your heart rate and blood pressure plummet and your brain’s blood supply dips, leading to blurry vision, lightheadedness and loss of consciousness.Various theories have been proposed about how this reaction could have been evolutionarily beneficial: When struck by a predator, fainting can make you appear dead, shielding you from further attack. And if you sustain an injury from a sharp object, a drop in blood pressure and heart rate might mitigate the blood loss. My own theory is that fainting is self-protective against pain. If you’ve been mortally wounded, losing consciousness would make those last moments less distressing.Physical maneuvers — such as crossing your legs and clenching your glute muscles — have been shown to rapidly combat fainting tendencies during blood draws. Just be careful not to bear down like you would during a bowel movement as this can actually impede blood return to the heart. People with an extreme fear of blood or the related blood-injury-injection phobia may benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy.Not every blood test I order is urgent. If you have multiple physician visits in a month, don’t be shy to ask your doctor if it’s safe to wait to get your blood drawn in one batch after all your appointments are completed. If it’ll spare you an extra needle-stick, waiting another week or two is often completely fine, but so many people never ask.Meet the doctor: Trisha S.

{"id": 82, "Title": "Medical Mysteries: A surgeon’s ominous pain and a question of grilled meat", "Description": "Seated next to a radiologist, Thomas P. Trezona scoured the images of his CT scan, dreading the thing he was sure he would find: evidence of pancreatic cancer, the same disease that had killed his mother. Given his age, sex and family history, that was the most likely explanation for the violent abdominal pain, nausea and rapid weight loss that in July 2021 hijacked the life of the retired surgical oncologist.To Trezona’s enormous relief the scan showed no sign of cancer. His internist suspected he was reacting to grain in his diet, while blood tests performed after the scan suggested a rare, chronic gastrointestinal disorder.The cause of Trezona’s debilitating symptoms, confirmed nearly two months later following surgery, turned out to be none of those things. The surgeon’s persistent, methodical approach to his own illness — honed during his long medical career — coupled with the assistance of his longtime gastroenterologist led to the discovery of the unusual and preventable reason for his alarming decline.Trezona, now 72, recovered, although the experience left him shaken. He hopes to alert others to a frequently overlooked danger hiding in plain sight and spare them a similar ordeal.“I know I have very privileged access to the medical community, and knowledge most people don’t have,” said Trezona, who lives outside Eugene, Ore. “Most people would have suffered for a much longer period of time with this.”The vague pain in Trezona’s upper abdomen began July 13, a few days after he returned from a two-week rafting trip in the Grand Canyon. A few days later the pain worsened, and he felt bloated and nauseated and had trouble eating.Trezona, who retired in 2020, noted that the pain came in waves and tended to be milder in the morning, intensifying as the day wore on. He began putting together a differential diagnosis  — a list of possible conditions that share symptoms — a bedrock tool used by doctors.“This is what surgeons do,” he said. “We are the specialists called to the ER to see people who present with significant abdominal pain.” Trezona also began keeping a daily symptom journal to track his problem.His initial suspicion — that he had contracted an infectious disease caused by a parasite — was quickly ruled out. Trezona and his wife, Amy, had drunk filtered water on the trip; she was fine. And he didn’t have diarrhea, a hallmark of such infections.The next possibility was far more ominous. Trezona had treated many patients with gastrointestinal malignancies and had watched his own mother die of pancreatic cancer a few months after her diagnosis at age 74. In a previously healthy 71-year-old male, Trezona observed, persistent abdominal pain and unexplained weight loss was cancer until proved otherwise. He needed a CT scan ASAP but couldn’t get an appointment with his internist until Aug. 2.Increasingly worried, he sent a text to his friend and gastroenterologist Jonathan Gonenne, who was on vacation in New England.During a phone call the next day they discussed Trezona’s symptoms. The gastroenterologist called his office to order a scan, which was scheduled for early August.Gonenne remembers feeling concerned. “This is not a guy who complains or exaggerates,” he said.A week before his test, Trezona was struck by spasms of pain so severe they left him writhing on the bathroom floor. Weak, bloated and nauseated but unable to vomit, he was taken to a nearby emergency room by his wife. Maybe, he hoped, he could get that scan sooner.Trezona saw a nurse and a physician assistant who drew blood and ordered lab tests. After more than four hours in the waiting room, Trezona still hadn’t seen a doctor when his phone pinged with his results. All were normal except one. His eosinophil count, a type of disease-fighting white blood cell, was elevated. That could indicate an allergy, a parasitic infection or cancer.After learning he might need to wait another  four or  five hours before seeing a doctor, Trezona decided to head home. “I thought ‘I’m not going to die in the next 24 hours,’” he said. He had no fever, his pain was receding, and his total white blood cell count was normal, which ruled out a major infection or perforated bowel.The following week he saw his primary care doctor who discounted the elevated eosinophil count and handed Trezona information about a grain-free diet.Trezona said he immediately thought — but did not say — that the notion that his problem was food related was “the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard in my life.” He contacted Gonenne, who called in a prescription for an antispasmodic drug that slows gut contractions and an opioid painkiller. Neither helped much.Trezona was deeply worried that his pain, bloating and nausea were intensifying; in less than a month he had lost more than 15 pounds. When he examined his abdomen, he couldn’t feel anything suspicious; a colonoscopy performed six months earlier was normal.On Aug. 2 Trezona underwent the CT scan and reviewed the images with the radiologist. “I was pretty happy,” he said of the normal result. But he did not feel entirely relieved as he thought of patients with normal scans whose cancers had been discovered later during surgery.In late August, a week before his MRI, Trezona suddenly felt “much, much better. The pain, bloating and nausea just stopped, and I was eating again,” he recalled. Trezona was inclined to cancel the test, but Gonenne persuaded him to keep the appointment.Immediately after the procedure Gonenne called Trezona to say that while nothing was found to explain his pain, the radiologist had spotted something peculiar: an unidentified metal “artifact” in Trezona’s left upper abdomen. Had he undergone an abdominal procedure that used a magnetic metal clip?He had not, Trezona replied, but in 2020 he had undergone a prostate procedure that uses wires. Perhaps a wire had migrated through the prostate to his abdomen. The possibility seemed far-fetched but not impossible.Trezona called the radiologist and arranged to come in the next morning to compare the CT and MRI scans. They determined that the metal abnormality had been visible on the CT but was interpreted as a normal calcification on the wall of an artery, which it resembled. The prostate explanation was quickly ruled out after Trezona learned that the procedure involves nonmagnetic stainless steel wires. The wire in Trezona’s gut was magnetic.That left two unresolved questions: Where did the wire come from and how did it get there?Some years earlier Gonenne had treated a patient who suffered a microscopic perforation of the esophagus after unknowingly swallowing a wire bristle from a metal brush used to clean the grates of a barbecue grill. The wire had broken off and stuck to food where it went undetected.Such injuries are believed to be uncommon but underrecognized. In 2012 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported six cases treated at one Providence, R.I., hospital over a 15-month period; all were linked to the consumption of grilled meat. Two patients required emergency abdominal surgery.In 2014 doctors reported the case of a man who died of peritonitis caused by a grill brush wire discovered during an autopsy.A 2016 study estimated that between 2002 and 2014 1,700 American children and adults sought treatment in an ER for such injuries; one in four required hospitalization. Two years later Consumer Reports warned about the potential danger wire brushes pose; the Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends the use of nylon brushes or balled up aluminum foil to clean grills.Gonenne suspected that Trezona unknowingly swallowed a wire stuck to his steak that traveled down his esophagus and into his stomach where it caused painful spasms before it migrated through the thick wall of the stomach. The resulting rapid weight loss probably led to a gallstone.“We didn’t go into surgery knowing this was a grill bristle,” Gonenne said. Trezona, who said he had never heard that grill brushes could pose a hazard, was determined to find out if it was the culprit in his case. Using one finger he easily popped a wire off his brush.On Sept. 13 the surgeon who removed Trezona’s gallbladder also managed to extract a small portion of abdominal tissue containing the two centimeter long wire.A few days after his operation Trezona took the wire he had detached to the pathology lab for comparison with the one retrieved from his stomach. Under the microscope it was an exact match down to the carbon pattern, which was determined to be burned barbecue sauce.“It was just incredible,” said Trezona, who had already tossed his grill brush.Trezona, who has fully recovered, said that his two-month ordeal stirred memories of some of his oncology patients. And it led him to appreciate in a way he hadn’t previously how severe undiagnosed pain made him feel alone, frightened and desperate, despite his long experience as a surgeon.“I remember thinking ‘I’m dying from this thing, and no one can figure out what it is,’” he said. Gonenne’s steadfast support and help, he added, were invaluable.For Gonenne, Trezona’s case reinforced the importance of reviewing images from scans and other primary data himself, not just accepting the conclusions of other doctors. “It’s so important when cases aren’t straightforward,” he noted.“Tom is phenomenal at that,” Gonenne added. “He’s very detail oriented.”In Gonenne’s view, Trezona’s determination drove the search for an answer. “This is not something at the forefront of a work-up for abdominal pain and weight loss,” the gastroenterologist observed. “I might ask about aspirin use and medication, but not ‘Have you been grilling?’”But, he added, “It’s a case I’ll not forget.”Submit your solved medical mystery to sandra.boodman@washpost.com.

{"id": 83, "Title": "New security clearance system is years late, its cost estimate unreliable", "Description": "After a 2015 cybersecurity hack exposed personal data of more than 21 million federal employees and contractors, the Pentagon took over development of a new IT system from the Office of Personnel Management.Defense Department officials launched plans in 2016 for a National Background Investigation Services (NBIS) system that would manage a range of employment-related functions, such as job applications; background checks for potential employees; and continual monitoring of current staffers, including those with security clearances, to ensure they remain fit for government work.Things have not gone as planned.The new system for employee vetting and security clearances was originally slated to be fully operational in 2019. Four years later, it is not yet launched, nor is it expected to be up and running until next year, according to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued last week.Furthermore, no one knows how much it will cost because previous estimates by the Pentagon’s Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA), established in 2019 to oversee the new system, have been “not reliable,” GAO found. GAO concluded that as a result, the agency simply “may be unable to effectively project” the cost of the system.The agency conducts 95 percent of all federal background investigations for more than 100 agencies.Another problem: one-quarter of the system’s program management office’s 149 civilian positions were vacant as of March.Declaring himself “deeply disappointed” by the lack of progress, Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that “our slow and inefficient background check system is bad for national security. Qualified talent ends up leaving for the private sector while awaiting their clearances, while recent breaches have illustrated that we’re giving clearances to people who can’t be trusted with our nation’s secrets.”The security agency has scored some progress, notably in the development of an eApplication, or eApp, that applicants use to begin the employment-vetting process. Most agencies are expected to use eApp by September.“DOD has delivered some NBIS system capabilities,” GAO wrote, “but continued delays hinder progress. Additionally, DCSA continues to lack a reliable implementation schedule for the NBIS program.” That’s despite previous audits, including a 2021 GAO finding that the Pentagon did “not have a reliable schedule to help manage” the system.The new report is yet another example of why GAO has repeatedly proclaimed that the government’s cybersecurity operations are at “high risk.” GAO designated information security a government-wide high-risk area in 1997. Protection of critical cyber infrastructure was added to the list in 2003. It was expanded in 2015 to include protecting personally identifiable information. The government-wide personnel security clearance process made the high-risk hall of shame in 2018.But despite GAO’s 26 years of badgering, Uncle Sam still has trouble getting his cybersecurity act together, so it remains at high risk.“Since 2010, we have made more than 4,000 recommendations to agencies aimed at addressing cybersecurity challenges facing the government,” GAO wrote in an April high-risk report to Congress. “More than 670 of these recommendations were made since the last high-risk update in 2021. As of February 2023, more than 850 recommendations had not been fully implemented, including 52 of 133 priority recommendations, which we believe warrant priority attention from heads of key departments and agencies.”Now, the August report calls for congressional intervention in the employee-vetting process.“The lack of progress in addressing schedule weaknesses and the program’s unreliable cost estimate warrant congressional consideration,” GAO said, “because these issues could further delay the NBIS system’s planned replacement of legacy personnel vetting systems in 2024—nearly a decade after those systems were compromised in 2015.”After $654 million was spent from 2017 through 2022, the Pentagon’s background investigation system cost estimate for fiscal 2023-2027 is $767.9 million. That’s pocket change in Washington, but the estimate might as well be tossed in the junk folder because “this cost estimate is minimally accurate, minimally comprehensive, not credible, and minimally well-documented,” according to GAO.GAO also found that of eight schedule and cost-estimate best practices related to the new system, seven have been “minimally met” and one — the credibility of cost estimates — was “not met.”Transferring security clearance operations from the personnel office to the Pentagon was never going to be a “silver bullet for the federal government’s security clearance challenges,” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (Va.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Accountability subcommittee on cybersecurity, information technology and government innovation. “DOD suffers from the same IT deficiencies as the rest of the government. It just happens to have more money and is more resistant to oversight and accountability. As we have seen with other persistent IT failures, DOD’s poor management of the NBIS transition is now harming agency operations.”The Pentagon did not reply to questions from The Post, but it did agree with GAO’s recommendation that Congress require the Defense Department “to develop a reliable NBIS program schedule and cost estimate based on GAO best practices.”Despite failing the best-practices test, Defense did get good grades from industry representatives who work with the security clearance system. In a GAO survey, they were generally satisfied with the security agency’s engagement, training and opportunities for feedback.That’s encouraging to Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a think tank focusing on improving the federal government. Yet, “security clearances continue to be a major … impediment to getting talent in the door,” he said. “It’s a big issue. It’s a really, really important issue.”Government technology “is truly fundamental to good delivery of public service,” but it has “slipped substantially,” Stier added. “Unfortunately, this is the norm in our government.”", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/25/nbis-security-clearances-gao/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 25, 2023", "Tag": "International political", "Keywords": "Keywords: Cybersecurity, NBIS system, Background investigations."}
{"id": 84, "Title": "The mug shot seen ’round the world: Donald Trump’s forever photo", "Description": "A picture may be worth a thousand words. Donald Trump’s Fulton County mug shot is worth all that and 13 counts in the Georgia indictment filed last week.Trump, 77, is known for mugging for the camera. Now, he has a mug shot, the first former president to be the subject of one. (Also, the first to earn an inmate number: P01135809.) Dominating in the polls for the 2024 GOP nomination and the subject of four separate indictments, Trump is used to playing to the cameras and by his own rules. In an age of Photoshop, A.I. and airbrushing, of fakery and distrust, the mug shot is authentic and frequently without mercy.How does Trump look, dressed in a navy suit, crisp white shirt and red tie? Perturbed. Here for the business. Like the camera is his opponent on the political battlefield and in the courtroom, a stand-in for Fulton County District Attorney Fani T. Willis. Brows slanted into acute angles; his recorded “blonde or strawberry” hair, a meringue, almost airborne, at odds with the gravity of his countenance.His eyes tilt up toward the camera while his chin pulls south. In his booking record, Trump states that he is 6-foot-3 and weighs 215 pounds, almost 30 pounds lighter than his White House physical in June 2020. Trump’s right side, partially draped in shadow, creates a touch of chiaroscuro, light reckoning with the dark. The mug shot is positively Baroque.Will the image be weaponized by Trump supporters and detractors? Undoubtedly. Will it become ubiquitous? Unquestionably.Trump’s image was ordered to “try and embarrass him,” daughter-in-law Lara Trump told Newsmax on Wednesday, claiming it’s “going to backfire on them.” Among Trump supporters, the image is “going to be on posters and people’s dorm rooms. It’s going to be on T-shirts.”It’s the mug shot seen ’round the world.This is the week the lights went on in Georgia. The Fulton County Jail in Atlanta became the processing center for Trump and 18 co-defendants in the Georgia indictment charging that they broke the law in attempting to reverse Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory. The jail dispensed a steady album of mug shots like a law-enforcement Fotomat.A mug shot is forever. Once seen, it is impossible to be unseen. It cannot be deleted from the internet or national memory. It’s a visual bullet that sears. It frames defendants in a photographic holding cell, captive, often blasted with severe lighting at unflattering angles. The mug shot is the antithesis of a selfie, the subject deprived of control. There are no do-overs.Trump’s love affair with the camera is among his most enduring and primary relationships, essential to his profound ardor of the spotlight. In his homes, he likes to surround himself with his likeness. In images, he is prone to pouting and squinting so he resembles Winston Churchill, per a 2017 New York Times report. Aides told the outlet that he is also an exacting editor of published images.A cluster of the first nine defendant images released Wednesday appeared in three stacked rows like some RICO-alleged version of “Hollywood Squares” or “The Brady Bunch.” Here you are, yoked together in one of life’s least desirable photo collections. Even before Trump boarded a plane from New Jersey, Photoshoppers went into overdrive crafting alternate mug shots of him and his co-defendants for internet consumption.In every mug shot, the Fulton County sheriff’s seal hovers in the left-hand corner as a constant Let’s not forget why you’re all here. Many of the images appear to be shot from a camera positioned above the defendants, which is why many of them gaze skyward in their mug shots, as if to visually reinforce that the criminal justice system is up here and that alleged scofflaws are beholden to our rules, our authority.Former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows’s shot is a watery blur. Lawyer John Eastman, blanched by light, looks haunted, a specter. Lawyer Ray S. Smith III features a dangerous Elvis-like curl. Lawyer Kenneth Chesebro, his impressive forehead aglow, resembles a miserable version of Kyle McLachlan’s FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper in “Twin Peaks.” (Then again, Agent Cooper often looked miserable.) Lawyer Sidney Powell eschewed the animal prints and emphatic accessories for a crisp white top, her chin tucked.Departing his home en route to Georgia on Wednesday, former Trump adviser and former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York Rudy Giuliani said: “I get photographed. Isn’t that nice? A mug shot for the man who probably put the worst criminals of the 20th century in jail.” In his 21st-century photo, Giuliani gives off Uncle Leo vibes from “Seinfeld.”For her mug shot, former Trump campaign attorney Jenna Ellis presents a generous, school photo day smile, a radical break with jailhouse imagery, as though she is visiting Georgia for a peach festival and belongs to an alternate, felicitous group of alleged co-conspirators. Surrender? Ellis’s photo says, “Happy to be here, Sheriff Pat Labat.”Who smiles sober for a mug shot or government-issued IDs? For passport photos, the U.S. State Department requests “a neutral facial expression with both eyes open and mouth closed.” On X, the social platform formerly known as Twitter, Ellis suggested the mug shot was her “#NewProfilePic,” the wide grin rooted in her faith, quoting Psalms, “Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, you righteous ones.” In a matter of hours, and now a million views, the mug shot had become a source of pride, an image to behold.Just before 10 p.m. Thursday, Trump posted his photo on X, “MUG SHOT — August 24, 2023,” proclaiming “Election Interference,” “Never Surrender!” and listed his campaign website address, where the Fulton County jail image is prominently featured and there is, indeed, already mug shot merch for sale ($34 for a “Never Surrender!” T-shirt). It was his first post on the social media platform since he was banned in January 2021.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2023/08/25/why-donald-trump-mugshot-matters/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 25, 2023", "Tag": "International political", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 85, "Title": "Elon Musk stopped policing political misinformation. The tech industry followed.", "Description": "Social media companies are receding from their role as watchdogs against political misinformation, abandoning their most aggressive efforts to police online falsehoods in a trend expected to profoundly affect the 2024 presidential election.An array of circumstances is fueling the retreat: Mass layoffs at Meta and other major tech companies have gutted teams dedicated to promoting accurate information online. An aggressive legal battle over claims that the Biden administration pressured social media platforms to silence certain speech has blocked a key path to detecting election interference.And X CEO Elon Musk has reset industry standards, rolling back strict rules against misinformation on the site formerly known as Twitter. In a sign of Musk’s influence, Meta briefly considered a plan last year to ban all political advertising on Facebook. The company shelved it after Musk announced plans to transform rival Twitter into a haven for free speech, according to two people familiar with the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive matters.The retrenchment comes just months ahead of the 2024 primaries, as GOP front-runner Donald Trump continues to rally supporters with false claims that election fraud drove his 2020 loss to Joe Biden. Multiple investigations into the election have revealed no evidence of fraud, and Trump now faces federal criminal charges connected to his efforts to overturn the election. Still, YouTube, X and Meta have stopped labeling or removing posts that repeat Trump’s claims, even as voters increasingly get their news on social media.Trump capitalized on those relaxed standards in his recent interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, hosted by X. The former president punctuated the conversation, which streamed Wednesday night during the first Republican primary debate of the 2024 campaign, with false claims that the 2020 election was “rigged” and that the Democrats had “cheated” to elect  Biden.On Thursday night, Trump posted on X for the first time since he was kicked off the site, then known as Twitter, following the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. Musk reinstated his account in November. The former president posted his mug shot from Fulton County, Ga., where he was booked Thursday on charges connected to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. “NEVER SURRENDER!” read the caption.Musk’s ‘free speech’ agenda dismantles safety work at Twitter, insiders sayThe evolution of the companies’ practices was described by more than a dozen current and former employees, many of them speaking on the condition of anonymity to offer sensitive details. The new approach marks a sharp shift from the 2020 election, when social media companies expanded their efforts to police disinformation. The companies feared a repeat of 2016, when Russian trolls attempted to interfere in the U.S. presidential campaign, turning the platforms into tools of political manipulation and division.These pared-down commitments emerge as covert influence campaigns from Russia and China have grown more aggressive, and advances in generative artificial intelligence have created new tools for misleading voters.Experts in disinformation say the dynamic headed into 2024 calls for more aggressive efforts to combat it, not less.“Musk has taken the bar and put it on the floor,” said Emily Bell, a professor at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, where she studies the relationship between tech platforms and news publishers. For the 2024 presidential election, misinformation around races is “going to be even worse,” she added.The social media platforms say they still have tools to prevent the spread of misinformation.“We remove content that misleads voters on how to vote or encourages interference in the democratic process,” YouTube spokesperson Ivy Choi said in a statement. “Additionally, we connect people to authoritative election news and information through recommendations and information panels.”Meta spokeswoman Erin McPike said in a statement that “protecting the U.S. 2024 elections is one of our top priorities, and our integrity efforts continue to lead the industry.”Changing Facebook’s algorithm won’t fix polarization, new study findsYet it is already changing what some users see online. Earlier this month, the founder of a musical cruise company posted a screenshot on Facebook appearing to show Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) falsely signing a bill that would allow undocumented immigrants to become police officers and sheriff’s deputies. “In Illinois American citizens will be arrested by illegals,” reads the post, which has been shared more than 26o times.Fact-checkers at USA Today, one of dozens of media organizations Meta pays to debunk viral conspiracies, deemed the post false, and the company labeled it on Facebook as “false information.” But Meta has quietly begun offering users new controls to opt out of the fact-checking program, allowing debunked posts such as the falsified one about Pritzker to spread in participants’ news-feeds with a warning label. Conservatives have long criticized Meta’s fact-checking system, arguing it is biased against them.Meta Global Affairs President Nick Clegg said the ability to opt out represents a new direction that empowers users and eases scrutiny over the company. “We feel we’ve moved quite dramatically in favor of giving users greater control over even quite controversial sensitive content,” Clegg said. McPike added that the new fact-checking policy comes “in response to users telling us that they want a greater ability to decide what they see.”YouTube has also backed away from policing misleading claims, announcing in June it would no longer remove videos falsely saying the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump. Continuing to enforce the ban would curtail political speech without “meaningfully reducing the risk of violence or other real-world harm,” the company argued in a blog post.Inside the civil rights campaign to get Big Tech to fight the ‘big lie’These shifts are a reaction from social media executives to being battered by contentious battles over content and concluding there is “no winning,” said Katie Harbath, former director of public policy at Facebook, where she managed the global elections strategy across the company.“For Democrats, we weren’t taking down enough, and for Republicans we were taking down too much,” she said. The result was an overall sense that “after doing all this, we’re still getting yelled at … It’s just not worth it anymore.”For years, many of Meta’s trust and safety teams operated like a university. Driven by curiosity, employees were encouraged to seek out the thorniest problems on the platform — issues such as fraud, abuse, bias and attempts at voter suppression — and develop systems to help.But in the last year and a half, some workers say there has been a shift away from that proactive stance. Instead, they are now asked to spend more of their time figuring out how to minimally comply with a booming list of global regulations, according to four current and former employees.That’s a departure from the approach tech companies took after Russia manipulated social media to attempt to swing the 2016 election to Trump. The incident transformed Mark Zuckerberg into a symbol of corporate recklessness. So the Meta CEO vowed to do better.Zuckerberg apologizes, promises reform as senators grill him over Facebook’s failingsHe embarked on a public contrition tour and vowed to devote the company’s seemingly infinite resources to protecting democracy. “The most important thing I care about right now is making sure no one interferes with the various … elections around the world,” Zuckerberg told two Senate committees in 2018, the same year a Wired cover depicted him with a bruised and bloody face.In the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, social media companies ramped-up investigative teams to quash foreign influence campaigns and paid thousands of content moderators to debunk viral conspiracies. Ahead of the 2018 midterms, Meta gave reporters tours of its so-called “war room,” where employees monitored violent threats in real-time.Civil rights groups pressured the platforms — including in meetings with Zuckerberg and Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg — to bolster their election policies, arguing the pandemic and popularity of mail-in ballots created an opening for bad actors to confuse voters about the electoral process.“These platforms were making all sorts of commitments to content moderation and to racial justice and civil rights in general,” said Color of Change President Rashad Robinson, whose racial justice group helped organize an advertising boycott by more than 1,000 companies including Coca-Cola, The North Face and Verizon following the police murder of George Floyd.Zuckerberg once wanted to sanction Trump. Then Facebook wrote rules that accommodated him.They instituted strict rules against posts that might lead to voter suppression. As Trump questioned the validity of mail-in ballots in 2020, Facebook and Twitter took the unprecedented step of attaching information labels such as, “This claim about election fraud is disputed” to scores of misleading comments. Google restricted election-related ads and touted its work with government agencies, including the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force, to prevent election interference campaigns.In early January 2021, rioters incited by Trump assaulted the U.S. Capitol after organizing themselves, in part, on Facebook and Twitter. In response, Meta, Twitter, Google and other tech companies suspended Trump, forcibly removing the president from their platforms.The moment was the peak of social media companies’ confrontation with political misinformation.But as the tech giants grappled with narrowing profits, this proactive stance began to dissolve.In the summer of 2021, Meta’s Clegg embarked on a campaign to convince Zuckerberg and the company’s board members to end all political advertising on its social media networks — a policy already in place at Twitter. Meta’s decision not to fact-check politicians’ speech had triggered years of controversy, with activists accusing the company of profiting off the misinformation contained in some campaign ads. Clegg argued the ads caused Meta more political trouble than they were worth.Two years after Jan. 6, Facebook mulls if Trump is still a threatWhile Zuckerberg and other board members were skeptical, the company eventually warmed to the idea. Meta even planned to announce the new policy, according to two people.By July 2022, the proposal had been shelved indefinitely. Internal momentum to impose the new rule seemed to plummet after Musk boasted of his plans to turn Twitter into a safe haven for “free speech” — a principle Zuckerberg and some board members had always lauded, one of the people said.After Musk’s official takeover later that fall, Twitter would eventually rescind its own ban against political ads.“Elon’s position on that stuff definitely shifted the way the board and industry thought about [policy],” said one person who was briefed on the board discussions about the ad ban at Meta. “He came in and kinda blew it all up.”How Mark Zuckerberg broke Meta’s workforceAlmost immediately, Musk’s reign at Twitter forced his peers to rethink other industry standards.On his first night as owner, Musk fired Trust and Safety head Vijaya Gadde, whose job it was to guard the companies’ users against fraud, harassment and offensive content. Soon after, just days before the midterms, the company laid off more than half of its 7,500 workers, crippling the teams responsible for making high-stake decisions about what to do about falsehoods.The cuts and the evolving approach to moderating toxic content prompted advertisers to flee. But while advertisers were leaving, other tech companies were paying close attention to Musk’s moves.In a June interview with the right-leaning tech podcast host Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg said Musk’s decision to make drastic cuts to Twitter’s workforce — including by cutting non-engineers who worked on things such as public policy but didn’t build products — encouraged other tech leaders such as himself to consider making similar changes.“It was probably good for the industry that he made those changes,” Zuckerberg said. (Meta has since laid off more than 20,000 workers, part of an industry-wide trend.)The Elonization of Mark Zuckerberg: How the Meta CEO is playing it coolMusk reinstated high-profile conservative Twitter accounts, including Jordan Peterson, a professor who was banned from Twitter for misgendering a trans person, and the Babylon Bee, a conservative media company. Musk also brought back Republican politicians including Trump and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), whose personal account was banned for violating the platform’s covid-19 misinformation policies. He simultaneously suspended the accounts of journalists including Washington Post reporter Drew Harwell, CNN reporter Donie O’Sullivan and others who reported on Musk.A spike in hate speech on the site followed as users tested boundaries.The political winds facing Silicon Valley were shifting, too. Trump’s 2020 election rigging claims had inspired a slew of Republican candidates to echo his rhetoric, cementing election denialism as a core Republican talking point. In a May poll by CNN, 6 in 10 Republican voters said they believed Trump’s falsehoods that the 2020 election was rigged.Soon after Musk’s Twitter acquisition, scores of Republican candidates and right-wing influencers tested Meta, Twitter and other social media platforms’ resolve to fight election misinformation. In the months leading up to the midterms, far-right personalities and GOP candidates continued to spread election denialism on social media virtually unchecked.This year, GOP election deniers got a free pass from Twitter and FacebookMark Finchem, the Republican candidate seeking to oversee Arizona’s election system as the state’s secretary of state, made a fundraising pitch on the eve of the 2022 election, falsely arguing on Facebook and Twitter that his Democratic opponent, Adrian Fontes, was a member of the Chinese Communist Party and a “cartel criminal” who had “rigged elections” before.When Twitter, seemingly in response to journalists’ questions, appeared to restrict his account, Musk declared he was “looking into” complaints that Finchem was being censored. Later that evening, Finchem was back to tweeting his message. He thanked Musk “for stopping the commie who suspended me from Twitter a week before the election.”Last year, Meta dissolved the responsible innovation team, a small group that evaluated the potential risks of some of Meta’s products, according to a person familiar with the matter, and simultaneously shuttered the much-touted Facebook Journalism Project, which was designed to promote quality information on the platform.“What was once promoted as part of an essential component of Meta’s role in helping secure democracy, election integrity and a healthy information ecosystem, appears now to have been expendable,” said Jim Friedlich, executive director of the Lenfest Institute for Journalism, which served for two years as a lead partner in helping execute Facebook’s journalism grantmaking.Trump’s ‘big lie’ fueled a new generation of social media influencersNow, Meta is eyeing ways to cut down on having to referee controversial political content on its new Twitter-like social media app, Threads. Instagram head Adam Mosseri, who led efforts to build Threads, said earlier this year that the platform would not actively “encourage” politics and “hard news,” because the extra user engagement is not worth the scrutiny.But even as it tries to retreat from the political culture wars, there’s no hiding from the coming election.Soon after the company launched Threads, Meta started warning users who tried to follow Donald Trump Jr. on the new social network that his account has repeatedly posted false information reviewed by independent fact-checkers. Trump Jr. posted a screenshot of the message on rival Twitter, complaining that “Threads not exactly off to a great start.”A Meta spokesperson responded by saying, “This was an error and shouldn’t have happened. It’s been fixed.”After the incident was over, Clegg told The Post he hopes in the future such politically fraught debates will disappear.“I hope over time we’ll have less of a discussion about what our big, crude algorithmic choices are and more about whether you guys feel that the individual controls we’re giving you on Threads feel meaningful to you,” he said.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/25/political-conspiracies-facebook-youtube-elon-musk/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 25, 2023", "Tag": "International political", "Keywords": "Keywords: Recession, Political Misinformation, Social Media Companies."}
{"id": 86, "Title": "Vivek Ramaswamy says ‘hoax’ agenda kills more people than climate change", "Description": "“The climate change agenda is a hoax … The reality is more people are dying of bad climate change policies than they are of actual climate change.”— Vivek Ramaswamy, during the first GOP presidential primary debate, Aug. 23We did an instant fact check of Wednesday’s presidential debate but decided to set aside this puzzling statement until we did more research.Many have interpreted Ramaswamy’s comment that the “climate change agenda is a hoax” as a flat statement that climate change is a hoax. But that doesn’t seem accurate, because a moment later he referred to deaths from “actual climate change.” Instead, he appeared to be suggesting that policies used to stem climate change don’t deliver what they promise and thus are a hoax.Ramaswamy, a business entrepreneur, is a fan of fossil fuels — in his closing statement he asserted that “fossil fuels are a requirement for human prosperity” — and many green energy projects, such as electric cars, seek to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. So that might be part of the reason for his skepticism.At The Fact Checker, we’re interested in numbers; in discussing climate change, Ramaswamy offered a big one. He asserted that more people were dying of bad climate policies than climate change itself. What’s that about?When we called Kristie L. Ebi, a professor at the Center for Health and the Global Environment at the University of Washington, she was at a loss: “I would ask his staff — what climate policies?” She noted that President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act is the first major U.S. green energy program passed into law and that “it is just starting.”Ebi paused. “I don’t understand.”Neither did we. But Ramaswamy’s staff did not answer our queries on this statement — though it responded to another one. That’s often suspicious. It usually means the staff doesn’t have data to back up the boss’s claim. Despite diligent searching, we could not find any study that accounted for such deaths.In other words, we’re missing half of Ramaswamy’s equation — deaths from climate change policies. But there are plenty of estimates on deaths from climate change around the world. Of course, these are all estimates, and so depend on a variety of assumptions. But they were produced by credible organizations.The World Health Organization in 2014 concluded that between 2030 and 2050, an additional 250,000 deaths a year would take place because of climate change, mostly through hunger, communicable diseases, malaria and dengue fever — all fostered by longer rainy seasons. In 2030, there would be 38,000 deaths due to heat exposure in elderly people, 48,000 due to diarrhea, 60,000 due to malaria and 95,000 due to childhood undernutrition. Mitigation efforts between 2030 and 2050 would reduce deaths from undernutrition and diarrhea, the WHO said, but heat deaths would soar to 100,000 a year.Ebi said the report is considered authoritative, but many experts now believe the potential deaths were significantly underestimated by WHO, perhaps even by half.That’s the future. Looking backward, the World Meteorological Organization in May concluded that extreme weather, climate and water-related events caused 11,000 reported disasters between 1970 and 2021, resulting in just over 2 million deaths. Nine out of 10 deaths took place in developing countries. Economic losses amounted to $4.3 trillion.Whether all of these deaths are the result of climate change could be subject to dispute. Many of the highest death tolls from extreme weather took place decades ago; better weather forecasting and improved disaster response have helped reduce death tolls. The highest death tolls listed by WMO are 300,000 from a 1983 drought in Ethiopia and 300,000 from a 1970 storm in Bangladesh. Among those on the top-10 list, the most recent was an estimate of nearly 56,000 dead in Russia from extreme temperatures in 2010.Extreme heat is one of the most visible manifestations of climate change. The WHO reported in November that at least 15,000 people had died of heat in 2022, including nearly 4,000 deaths in Spain, more than 1,000 in Portugal, more than 3,200 in Britain and about 4,500 deaths in Germany. Europe is the fastest-warming region in the world, with average temperatures spiking since 1961.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a steady increase in deaths from high temperatures since 2014, when 407 were recorded, to 2022, when 1,714 were recorded. The figures jump around a bit — in 1999, 2006, and 2011 there were more than 1,000 heat-related fatalities — but the trend has been clear for the past six years.Again, not every heat-related death can be attributed to climate change. A well-regarded study published in 2021 in the journal Nature Climate Change found that, on average, 37 percent of heat deaths in warm seasons could be attributed to climate change.We should note that on social media earlier this month, Ramaswamy posted that “the climate disaster death rate has *declined* by 98% over the last century, even as carbon emissions have risen,” attributing that decline to fossil fuels. Not only is that different from what he said in the debate, but experts say better weather forecasting and warning systems are largely responsible.Harvard-led research published in 2021 determined that the burning of fossil fuel was responsible for 1 out of 5 deaths worldwide. That adds up to more than 8 million people a year — a population the size of New York City.No matter how you slice it, credible research has concluded that thousands of people a year die because of the effects of climate change. We can’t find data that suggests green energy policies actually kill even more people — and Ramaswamy’s campaign did not provide any source for his claim.

{"id": 87, "Title": "Donald Trump marks return to X, formerly Twitter, with mug shot tweet", "Description": "Former president Donald Trump made a return to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, late Thursday, with his account sharing his mug shot and a link to his website hours after his surrender and subsequent release from an Atlanta jail on charges connected to his attempts to reverse the 2020 election results in Georgia.“Never surrender,” the caption read.https://t.co/MlIKklPSJT pic.twitter.com/Mcbf2xozsYTrump’s account had been suspended by the social media platform after the Jan. 6, 2021, riots, over concern about “risk of further incitement of violence.” Elon Musk reinstated the account in November after purchasing the platform, but Trump had not tweeted since. He launched his own social network, Truth Social, in February 2022 and has mostly used that platform. He also shared the mug shot there just before the post on X.Trump surrenders at Fulton County Jail for his first mug shotThe return of Trump on X, where he has more than 86 million followers, came as he was booked on charges he broke Georgia laws with his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, producing the first mug shot of a former U.S. president. It also came ahead of a new presidential election cycle in which he faces three other indictments.The post was met with celebrations from his supporters, one of whom said that this tweet would go on to become the “most viewed” in the platform’s history. (Trump’s tweet had 17.6 million views by 11 p.m.).Musk shared the tweet, writing: “Next-level.”It remains unclear how active Trump will be on the site, which for years was inextricably linked with his political identity. During his presidency he used the site as a megaphone: amplifying his political agenda, commenting on foreign affairs or simply praising himself. He also promoted conspiracy theories, branded media outlets as enemies of the people and targeted minorities with his tweets and retweets.Previously Trump had said that he would not rejoin Twitter, which Musk rebranded as X this year. “The response on TRUTH is much better than being on Twitter,” he told Fox News in April 2022.During negotiations for an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson this month, Trump told advisers he didn’t want the interview to show up on X because it competes with Truth Social. Carlson and his team, who had been developing ties with Musk and X for months, balked, telling Trump that his social media platform didn’t have enough reach to do justice to such a high-profile interview.Trump once reconsidered sticking with Truth Social. Now he’s stuck.Other social media platforms that banned Trump after Jan. 6, 2021, have also restored the former president’s accounts in the more than 2½ years since his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, despite pushback from some civil rights groups that have demanded a permanent ban.A recent report by Accountable Tech, a nonprofit that advocates for better security and integrity in big tech, found that 360 of Trump’s posts on Truth Social would be in violation of Facebook’s Community Standards, dozens contained election-related disinformation and more than 100 posts amplify followers or supporters of QAnon.In January, Meta, Facebook’s parent company, announced it was lifting its ban. In March, YouTube followed suit.Hours after the Google-owned video site restored the account, Trump posted to both platforms. In a post accompanied by a CNN video clip from when he was elected, Trump wrote: “I’M BACK!”", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/24/trump-back-twitter-mugshot/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 25, 2023", "Tag": "International political", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 88, "Title": "The winners and losers from the first Republican debate", "Description": "Eight Republican presidential candidates who sought some kind of traction against former president Donald Trump faced off Wednesday night at the first debate of the 2024 GOP primary race in Milwaukee. Trump was absent.Here’s who and what landed — and didn’t.Donald TrumpIt could scarcely have turned out better for the absentee front-runner. He decided to skip the debate because it wasn’t worth his time — what with his nearly 40-point lead in the polls. And the candidates who want to beat him spent much of the debate pretending he wasn’t even in the race.Over nearly the whole first hour of the two-hour debate, Trump was invoked substantially only by one candidate, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who lumped him in with other Republicans onstage whom she accused of spending irresponsibly.“The truth is that Biden didn’t do this to us. Our Republicans did this to us when they passed that $2.2 trillion covid stimulus bill,” Haley said. She mentioned her opponents’ votes to raise the debt ceiling and added, “Donald Trump added $8 trillion to our debt, and our kids are never going to forgive us for this.”Near the hour mark, Fox News’s moderators teased an upcoming segment about Trump’s indictments. The audience booed. What followed was a conversation that was less about the indictments and more about whether then-Vice President Mike Pence did the right thing on Jan. 6, 2021.When candidates did draw seeming contrasts, they often avoided using Trump’s name.Without Trump, Republican debate attacks focus on Ramaswamy and BidenAbout the closest anyone got to a true broadside against Trump was former New Jersey governor Chris Christie calling Trump’s conduct — regardless of his guilt — “beneath the office of the president of the United States.”Only he and former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson said they wouldn’t support a convicted Trump in the general election, with Hutchinson floating the idea that Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol might have disqualified him to serve as president under the 14th Amendment.The risk for Trump in not showing up was that he wouldn’t be able to defend himself. He didn’t have to.Vivek RamaswamyIn Trump’s absence, second-place Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis seemed destined for most of the attacks. Instead, it was Ramaswamy, the momentum candidate in the race who has risen to third place.Ramaswamy’s frequent foils worked most: Pence and Christie.Both dismissed Ramaswamy as a political amateur. Christie compared Ramaswamy’s first answer, in which Ramaswamy called himself “a skinny guy with a funny last name,” to Barack Obama. (Obama indeed once said something very similar.) He also memorably labeled Ramaswamy “a guy who sounds like Chat GPT.”But Ramaswamy was unfazed through just about all of it. And over and over again, he benefited from being pitted against the two most unpopular candidates in the field.He got in perhaps the most pronounced defense of Trump, accusing Christie of “blindly bashing Trump without an iota of vision for this country.” It was a line that DeSantis’s super PAC wanted its candidate to land, according to a memo leaked last week, but Ramaswamy beat him to it.Ramaswamy also frequently cut in, gaming relatively lax enforcement of the debate rules to make himself the center of attention.If there were uneasy moments for Ramaswamy, it was when the candidates — including Haley — pressed him on his dovish approach to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “You are choosing a murderer over a pro-American country,” Haley said, earning loud applause.Haley also accused him of not standing by U.S. allies like Israel because he said he wanted to ultimately not have to send the country aid. “You have no foreign policy experience and it shows,” Haley added, again to loud applause.But it was about the only moment that the audience wasn’t on Ramaswamy’s side.Pence’s Jan. 6 decisionThe candidates did subtly break with Trump en masse on a major issue: his continued claim that Pence could have helped him overturn the election on Jan. 6.Every candidate who was asked about it said Pence did the right thing: Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Christie, Haley, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and DeSantis.DeSantis’s endorsement was less ample, though. After some pressing from Pence, he said: “Mike did his duty. I’ve got no beef with him. But here’s the thing: Is this what we’re going to be focusing on?”Christie said later: “Mike Pence stood for the Constitution. And he deserves not grudging credit; he deserves our thanks as Americans for putting his oath of office and the Constitution of the United States before personal, political and unfair pressure.”Ron DeSantisThe Florida governor ceded center stage to Ramaswamy for most of the night, and that’s not what he needed.If he had beneficial moments, they were when he positioned himself as the anti-covid-shutdown candidate. He also sought subtle contrasts with Trump, citing his landslide Florida reelection win in 2022 and saying, “You don’t take in someone like [coronavirus task force member Anthony Fauci] and coddle him.”But this is also a guy who badly needs to arrest his steady slide in this race. He needed this debate more than anyone, but it just wasn’t memorable in any way, shape or form.The GOP’s political prideHaley spent much of the debate painting a relatively bleak picture of the GOP’s political status.She said it didn’t have a leg to stand on in criticizing Democrats for excessive spending. She called its 2024 front-runner, Trump, “the most disliked politician in America.” And she spent much of a discussion on abortion downplaying the party’s ability to enact its agenda.“When you’re talking about a federal ban, be honest with the American people: We haven’t had 45 pro-life senators in over 100 years,” she said, adding that “you know we don’t have 60 Senate votes.”Others advocating federal bans pushed back, but Haley doubled down on her point that the party just hasn’t won this issue enough to be able to do such things.Haley launched her campaign making similar points about the GOP’s many popular-vote losses — seven of the last eight presidential elections, including both of Trump’s races. And while her display Wednesday night might not have done her too much good — who wants to be told what they’ve done wrong or can’t do? — she at least tried to give her party a wake-up call.Mike Pence and Tim ScottBoth have at least somewhat plausible claims to being formidable candidates — Pence as a former vice president and Scott as seemingly the most broadly agreeable candidate onstage — but both have languished in the low to mid-single digits.But like DeSantis, neither really showed much.Pence tried to make the case that he is the tried-and-true conservative in the race, but he seemed to be making a case to a Republican Party that doesn’t really exist anymore.Scott suffered from the same affliction. He gave arguably the most memorable answer for the antiabortion crowd, promoting a federal ban while saying it was wrong to allow states like California and New York not to have any restrictions. But he was largely a spectator.Fox NewsThe cable news station whose journalistic credibility is already tarnished by a momentous $787.5 million settlement in the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit didn’t exactly acquit itself.Candidates repeatedly disregarded the debate rules, with little in the way of an attempt to keep the proceedings on track. When candidates talked over moderators Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum as they tried to move on, the moderators often just relented and gave them the stage.But the problems were most evident in the moderators’ handling of hand-raising questions — a good and helpful entry at any debate.The first time they requested such responses, DeSantis objected to the format, and they let him do it, declining to make the request again.Later, they asked whether the candidates would support Trump in the general election if he is convicted. Only Christie and Hutchinson declined, but both DeSantis and Pence were slow to raise their hands. And for some reason, there was no follow-up with them.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/23/who-won-republican-debate/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 24, 2023", "Tag": "International political", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 89, "Title": "Americans aren’t sold on a Biden impeachment inquiry", "Description": "House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) is edging ever closer to an impeachment inquiry of President Biden, saying Tuesday that the House will launch one next month if its document requests aren’t satisfied.Such an inquiry would surely break ground in the politicization of impeachment; GOP theories about Biden’s proximity to Hunter Biden’s legal problems — most notably via a supposed “bribery scheme” — have borne little fruit, and evidence has also contradicted some of their central claims.McCarthy has been careful to specify that this would merely be an inquiry rather than a full-on impeachment vote, the suggestion being that Republicans are actually seeking the truth behind their theories. But such a step would surely be momentous and might set the House on an irreversible course.The GOP’s lengthy impeachment and censure listsAs for how Americans feel about all of this, we can say a few things:Let’s take each individually.In a new Fox News poll last week, 50 percent of Americans said they viewed Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine and China as being “illegal,” and more than 8 in 10 regarded them as at least “unethical.”Those are striking figures — higher than they were for virtually all of Trump’s controversies until recently. (Trump’s “illegal” numbers are now similar in some cases.)Clear majorities of Americans also disagree with how the case against Hunter Biden has been handled. They say the plea deal that has now fallen apart was not tough enough (55 percent), and that the deal was mainly driven by politics rather than the law (58 percent to 36 percent).An ABC News/Ipsos poll last week also showed that Americans lacked confidence that the investigation, which now includes special counsel status for U.S. Attorney David Weiss, would be handled fairly. Just 32 percent were at least somewhat confident it would be, while 48 percent were not too confident.And in earlier Reuters/Ipsos polling, Americans said, 50 percent to 30 percent, that they believed Hunter Biden was receiving preferential treatment because he’s the president’s son. Included in those saying that: 33 percent of Democrats.An impeachment inquiry, of course, would be about President Biden and not his son — or even the Justice Department’s handling of the case.And many Americans who see something unsavory in Hunter Biden’s actions or are skeptical of the DOJ’s conduct see that distinction.In the Reuters/Ipsos poll, Americans agreed, 51 percent to 33 percent, that Hunter Biden’s legal troubles were “independent of and unrelated to” Biden’s service as president. Independents said that by a 2-1 margin, and even 32 percent of Republicans agreed.And while half of Americans in the Fox News poll saw something illegal in Hunter Biden’s actions, 38 percent said the same of the president’s supposed connection to “his son’s business dealings.”That 38 percent is overwhelmingly Republican, with just 33 percent of independents seeing something illegal in the president’s actions.The polls suggest that Americans are significantly less in favor of a potential Biden impeachment than they were of Trump’s impeachments — most likely because of that perceived lack of connection between Biden and his son’s problems.The 38 percent of Americans who believe Biden did something illegal is actually similar to what was seen in early polls on the Ukraine scandal that touched off Trump’s first impeachment.But polling also shows that far fewer Americans see a Biden impeachment inquiry as being warranted.We don’t have extensive polling on this, but Ipsos early this month showed Americans split on a potential Biden inquiry, with 39 percent in favor and 38 percent against.By contrast, majorities of Americans and sometimes nearly 6 in 10 supported the two Trump impeachment efforts early on.Trump’s Jan. 6 impeachment moved quickly, so we didn’t get polling specifically on the initial inquiry. But Quinnipiac University, Monmouth University and Public Religion Research Institute polling showed between 55 percent and 59 percent of Americans supported actually impeaching Trump.The slower-moving Ukraine impeachment in late 2019 and early 2020, which included more of an inquiry phase, provides a more direct comparison.Shortly after the House launched its inquiry, polls generally showed half or more of Americans supported it. In a Washington Post-Schar School poll, Americans said 58 percent to 38 percent that the House was correct in its decision — a 20-point margin, compared to the current nearly even split on a Biden inquiry.That poll also showed that 57 percent of independents supported the Trump inquiry, compared to 33 percent for Biden today. And even 28 percent of Republicans supported an inquiry of Trump, compared to 11 percent of Democrats who support one of Biden now.Clearly, the consensus just isn’t there for a Biden impeachment inquiry in the way it was for Trump. But that doesn’t mean Republicans won’t try to force the issue.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/23/public-opinion-biden-impeachment/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 23, 2023", "Tag": "International political", "Keywords": "keywords: \n\n1.

{"id": 90, "Title": "5 key things to watch for in the first Republican presidential debate", "Description": "Eight of the top nine candidates for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination will face off in their first debate Wednesday night in Milwaukee. Absent will be the runaway front-runner, former president Donald Trump, who decided the debate wasn’t worth the risk.The debate is set for 9 p.m. Eastern on Fox News.Below are key themes to watch for and questions to be answered.Trying to actually run against Trump has already proved vexing for the field. An unstated rule is that you can’t really attack him and emerge with your career intact.Now, in the first major forum for at least drawing contrasts, they won’t have Trump there to engage with — or the viewers he most likely would have attracted.That could cut a couple of ways. One is that Trump also won’t be there to defend himself, so the candidates might feel freer to edge closer to more overt criticisms. But the other is that there will be no opportunity to trip him up and create the kind of defining moment that these debates usually provide.Particularly worth watching is how the candidates handle his four indictments. Apart from the most unabashed Trump critics — former governors Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson — the others have offered a gentler approach. Former vice president Mike Pence has said Trump asked him to violate the Constitution but hasn’t judged his former running mate too harshly. To the extent that others have sought traction, it’s been to suggest that the indictments are electoral liabilities, rather than that Trump actually did anything wrong.What to watch and who is participating in the first Republican debateBut what we’ve also seen is that this kid-gloves strategy has utterly failed. Trump has continued to extend his lead — it’s now nearly 40 points. The candidates have to ask themselves how much longer they’re willing to allow his biggest general-election liability to be an apparent asset in the primary.Many of them will want to mind their post-2024 careers, too, or perhaps even have designs on being Trump’s running mate. And the recent history of the GOP shows that everyone is generally content to wait and hope for someone else to do something about Trump.A leaked memo from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s super PAC last week suggests we should perhaps expect more of the same. The fourth “must-do” it lists for DeSantis? “4. Defend Donald Trump in absentia in response to a Chris Christie attack.”Part of the calculus for the reluctance to go directly at Trump is undoubtedly this theory: If Trump can be beaten, it will be because he implodes. And better to be next in line if that happens than to have incinerated yourself in August.Which means we could see plenty of jockeying to become what we’ve labeled the front-runner of the also-rans.If that’s the play Wednesday, you’ll probably see plenty of focus on DeSantis, whose long hold on that distinction is increasingly tenuous. DeSantis was once nearly tied with Trump in the polls and 30 points ahead of the third-place candidate; now he’s below 15 percent nationally and fending off political neophyte Vivek Ramaswamy.What might that look like? More traditional conservatives have attacked him for his heavy-handed use of the government to fight “wokeness,” notably by going after Disney. The other candidates could also attack him for his recent comments suggesting that some Trump supporters are “listless vessels.” Or you could see them try to bait DeSantis into the kind of awkwardness that has dogged his candidacy.Ramaswamy could also be an attractive foil, based on his third-place standing, past positions that haven’t been terribly GOP-friendly and some odd recent comments about foreign policy. (Ramaswamy this week said he had been misquoted talking about 9/11 conspiracy theories, but a recording soon showed he had been accurately quoted.)It’s a muddled mess behind Trump, DeSantis and arguably Ramaswamy, with no other candidate pulling even 5 percent in the national polling average.So who else could assert themselves?Plenty of eyes will be on Christie, who has clearly been anticipating his chance to bring the case against Trump to the debate stage. It might not help Christie, who has badly alienated much of the party with this approach, but he has shown he is willing to try to take people out even if it does him little good (see: Marco Rubio 2016). And Christie could even make himself a player in New Hampshire, where some polls have him running as high as second.Ramaswamy also has a stake. He’s built a significant following with a successful media-appearance strategy; now he gets tested face-to-face with his opponents and a chance to show he’s not just a novelty.The last candidate we’ll be keeping a close eye on is former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, who can be a skilled messenger but thus far hasn’t broken through — at all — in the 2024 race. The debate could be a good forum for the only female candidate onstage.Beyond the who’s-up-and-who’s-down nature of Wednesday’s affair will be what it says about the future of the Republican Party. One topic that should gain clarity is election denialism.Despite Trump’s continuing to press the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen, the GOP as a whole has tried to (gently) move on. Nearly all of Trump’s opponents have said, in varying ways, that Trump did lose the 2020 election.While we should hardly expect the candidates to disown the questioning of the 2020 results — as many as 7 in 10 Republicans still incorrectly believe that President Biden’s win was illegitimate — there are plenty of other ways to set the tone in the party.For instance, Fox News moderators would be derelict if they didn’t ask the candidates to weigh in on then-Vice President Pence’s decision to buck Trump’s plot on Jan. 6, 2021 — a decision that as many as half of Republican voters have supported. Trump’s dual indictments over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election would also seem to invite some in-depth questioning of those on the stage.The debate could give the GOP a real opportunity to more overtly shed this losing electoral issue, without Trump there to demagogue it. That is, if anyone cares to attempt this course.The Republican Party also needs to decide where it stands on two key issues on which there is no clear consensus among the 2024 presidential field: abortion and Ukraine.Analysis | On Ukraine, Republicans grapple with real political divisionsMultiple candidates have either shied away from the abortion issue (see: DeSantis) or struggled to strike a balance (see: Haley and Sen. Tim Scott) for fear of going too far now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned. They’ve dithered on questions about how early to restrict abortion, whether to ban it at the federal level and whether they agree with a judge’s decision to restrict abortion medication.We’ve also seen some efforts to highlight this reluctance and force the issue. Trump at one point even suggested that the six-week abortion ban DeSantis signed in Florida (but has declined to promote too much) went too far. And a key antiabortion group has at times sought to steer the candidates in a more ambitious direction, targeting both Trump and Haley after they didn’t toe its line.On Ukraine, you see one of the most pronounced divides in the field. Pence and Haley have hewed to the more traditionally hawkish conservative view that standing by Ukraine against Russia’s invasion is in the United States’ national security interest. Trump and DeSantis, on the other hand, have taken a dimmer view of U.S. involvement, which appears more in line with the activist base but not necessarily the party as a whole.Both issues are hugely consequential in America’s political landscape right now, with the GOP’s uncertain posture leaving open what will happen next. And both should feature significantly in Wednesday’s debate — and the debates ahead.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/23/republican-presidential-debate-key-themes/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 23, 2023", "Tag": "International political", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 91, "Title": "7 ways MAGA Republicans differ from other Republicans", "Description": "When Vice President Mike Pence declined to help President Donald Trump overturn the 2020 election on Jan. 6, 2021, he foreclosed whatever chance Trump had of staying in the White House — and probably any path Pence might have had of becoming president.The reason? Pence split the Republican Party along MAGA lines. In a new CBS News/YouGov poll, non-MAGA Republicans say that Pence did the right thing, 48 percent to 15 percent, but MAGA Republicans disapprove by a 2-to-1 margin. And Monmouth University polling from last month showed that while even non-MAGA Republicans are iffy on Pence, “strong” MAGA Republicans detest him: Just 22 percent had a favorable impression, while 60 percent had an unfavorable one.The MAGA split in the GOP is perhaps best exemplified by Pence’s travails, but that’s hardly the only area showing significant gaps.Polling has occasionally asked Republicans whether they identify with the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement, and we reached out to pollsters to get breakdowns on how these two sides of the party differ. Below are some of the most interesting findings.To start with, polls generally show that 4 to 5 in 10 Republican-leaning voters identify as MAGA. A Grinnell College poll late last year pegged the number at 42 percent. And the Monmouth poll last month showed that 31 percent identify as “strong” MAGA supporters, 21 percent identify as “somewhat” MAGA supporters, and 38 percent don’t support MAGA.While Trump strikes few as the embodiment of the evangelical Christian faith, the MAGA movement is much more evangelical than not.Strong MAGA supporters identify as evangelicals 60 percent to 39 percent in Monmouth polling, but those who lean Republican and don’t support the MAGA movement are nonevangelical by a similar margin, 59 percent to 36 percent.MAGA is also more conservative. In the Monmouth poll, 6 in 10 “very conservative” voters identify at least somewhat with MAGA, while 60 percent of moderates identify as non-MAGA.Suffolk University in a 2021 poll offered something of an analog: not whether voters described themselves as MAGA, but whether they were more loyal to Trump (akin to MAGA) or the GOP as a party (akin to non-MAGA). It found similar differences in these demographics, but relatively little differences across age, gender, region, income and education.Not only are MAGA supporters more conservative, but the Grinnell College poll showed that 65 percent of them identify as “strong” Republicans, compared to just 36 percent of non-MAGA supporters.That shouldn’t be mistaken for devotion to the party. The Suffolk poll showed Trump-first/MAGA supporters as less favorable toward the GOP (56 percent favorable to 29 percent unfavorable) than non-MAGA/party-first Republicans (70 percent favorable to 15 percent unfavorable).The Trump-first/MAGA supporters also said, 74 percent to 8 percent, that they would back a Trump-run third party, while the party-first crowd said it would stick with the GOP in that scenario, 58 percent to 15 percent.Trump-first/MAGA Republicans are more rigid in their views in the Suffolk poll.They prefer that Republicans stand up to President Biden, even if it means getting little done, over compromising to accomplish things, 75 percent to 16 percent. Party-first/non-MAGA Republicans are more open to compromise, though they still prefer the former approach, 48-37.Party-first and non-MAGA supporters are also slightly less disapproving of Biden (though all groups overwhelmingly disapprove). And non-MAGA Republicans are more willing to vote for Democrats, with AP VoteCast data showing that 10 percent crossed over in the 2022 House elections — a stat that cost the GOP dearly. (Just 2 percent of MAGA supporters voted for Democrats.)This goes without saying; MAGA is Trump’s movement, after all. But the degree is often striking.In the Monmouth poll, 61 percent of MAGA Republicans say they aren’t at all concerned about Trump’s indictments, compared to 39 percent of non-MAGA supporters.The same poll shows non-MAGA supporters about evenly split on whether Trump or Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) would be a more effective president, but strong MAGA Republicans say that’s Trump, 70 percent to 9 percent.The Suffolk poll also has 28 percent of party-first/non-MAGA Republicans saying that Trump was a “great president,” compared to 63 percent of Trump-first/MAGA supporters.MAGA Republicans are, as befits their hero, more conspiratorial and extreme.The Suffolk poll (conducted shortly after Jan. 6) showed 89 percent of Trump-first/MAGA Republicans said Biden wasn’t a legitimately elected president, compared to 59 percent of party-first/non-MAGA ones.Just one-quarter said Jan. 6 was a “riot” or “insurrection” (it was both), compared to more than 4 in 10 party-first/non-MAGA Republicans.At the time, Trump-first/MAGA Republicans were more likely to list either Newsmax or One America News as their most trusted news source (4 in 10) than to name Fox News (32 percent). Those outlets had gone even further than Fox to promote Trump’s stolen-election fantasy. Only 15 percent of party-first/non-MAGA Republicans preferred those outlets.Trump-first/MAGA Republicans were also twice as likely as party-first/non-MAGA supporters to say they wouldn’t get the coronavirus vaccine.And a recent poll from Vanderbilt University showed a particularly pronounced gap on the question of who was the better president, Biden or Russia’s Vladimir Putin. While 70 percent of non-MAGA Republicans said Biden was better, 52 percent of MAGA Republicans preferred Putin.The splits in the ways MAGA Republicans and non-MAGA Republicans approach the 2024 election are perhaps unsurprising. But what’s interesting is how much even non-MAGA Republicans are falling in line behind Trump.The Monmouth poll in March showed Trump underwater among non-MAGA Republicans, 39 percent favorable to 48 percent unfavorable. But that result has since flipped, with them now liking Trump 55 percent to 34 percent.Over that span, Trump has turned a 33-19 deficit against DeSantis among non-MAGA Republicans in a crowded field into a slight 24-19 advantage.A majority of non-MAGA Republicans now say Trump is probably the party’s strongest general election candidate, while only 29 percent saying DeSantis would be stronger.Needless to say, if Trump is winning non-MAGA Republicans, he is going to win the nomination.MAGA Republicans are, of course, willing to turn on a dime against anybody who runs afoul of Trump.And it’s not just former Trump vice president Pence; it’s also the two most forceful Trump critics in the field. Strong MAGA Republicans absolutely despise former Trump ally Chris Christie (6 percent favorable, 70 percent unfavorable in the Monmouth poll), and the ones who know about former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson feel much the same about him (6 percent favorable to 28 percent unfavorable).They also aren’t that enamored of former Trump United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, who briefly tried to turn on Trump after Jan. 6. While 37 percent like her, 27 percent dislike her.This points to perhaps MAGA’s greatest impact: Making anyone who parts with Trump regret it, and keeping the party in line in the process.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/22/maga-republicans-analysis/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 22, 2023", "Tag": "International political", "Keywords": "Keywords: Pence, MAGA, Republican Party."}
{"id": 92, "Title": "Trump voters trust him more than they trust friends and family", "Description": "The big finding from the new CBS News-YouGov survey is that Donald Trump has expanded his national lead in the Republican presidential primary to 46 points. That’s one of his largest margins to date.But another finding has also caught plenty of people’s eyes. It’s that more Trump voters trust him than trust their own friends and family, conservative media or even religious leaders.The percentages who say they trust each of the following to tell them what’s true breaks down like this:In one way, this finding is stunning, given that Trump’s presidency involved more than 30,000 false and misleading claims. Trump voters trust him even more than they do the people they know and love — what could be more emblematic of the informational bubble that exists around him?But in other ways, the finding, which masks the low level of trust that Trump engenders overall, isn’t all that surprising.The first thing to note is that these are the people who are voting for Trump. So it’s a self-selecting group. Of course lots of Trump voters say they trust him. When you take into account all GOP primary voters, however, the number drops substantially, to 53 percent. That’s less than the percentage who trust their friends and family, and it shows that a strong majority of non-Trump GOP voters mistrust him.Which is something we’ve seen before. Polling has repeatedly shown that Americans overall and even many Republicans have a very low degree of trust in the Man of 30,000 Distortions.In a recent Fox News survey, Americans said by a more than 2-to-1 margin, 67 percent to 31 percent, that the phrase “honest and trustworthy” doesn’t describe Trump. The level of trust in Trump even among his base is also relatively low. Fully 33 percent of those who voted for Trump in 2020, and 37 percent of Republicans overall, said he wasn’t honest and trustworthy. (A Washington Post-ABC News poll around the same time featured similar numbers.)Even within Trump’s base of GOP primary voters, though, we shouldn’t be terribly surprised.One reason is that supporters often place this level of trust in their chosen candidate. An Ipsos poll last year showed that more Democrats trusted President Biden (80 percent) than anyone except Anthony S. Fauci (84 percent) and their personal doctor or health-care provider (90 percent).(Biden has his own problems with telling the truth, though nowhere near on the scale of Trump.)Another reason we shouldn’t be surprised is that, while the poll is partially about faith in Trump personally, it also reflects what he’s being compared to.Regular Gallup polling has shown Americans’ confidence in the church and organized religion falling to about half of where it was at the turn of the 21st century. Only 49 percent of Republicans now say they have at least “quite a lot” of confidence in that institution — similar to the 42 percent of GOP primary voters who say they trust religious leaders in the new poll.An Ipsos poll earlier this year showed that just 45 percent of Americans had a “great deal” of trust in their friends. (It was higher — 61 percent — for family members.) So the idea that many Trump backers would mistrust even those close to them isn’t wholly surprising.Finally, there’s the question of how Republicans feel about conservative media outlets. It’s perhaps not surprising that they distrust the mainstream media, but polling has shown they also have a healthy degree of skepticism about conservative outlets.YouGov data from this spring actually showed more Democrats than Republicans trusted some conservative-leaning outlets, including the New York Post and National Review. Republicans’ trust in more Trump-friendly outlets like Fox News, Newsmax and One America News was also lower than Democrats’ faith in a whole slew of mainstream outlets.So basically, Trump engenders more trust among his most devoted supporters than groups that enjoy only middling levels of trust in the conservative base.Oh, and Trump’s level of trust from those devoted supporters? It’s actually not that great. That 71 percent is significantly lower than the 91 percent of “strong” Trump supporters — a slightly different but similar group — who said they trusted Trump for accurate information back in 2018.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/21/poll-trump-voters-trust/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 21, 2023", "Tag": "International political", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 93, "Title": "Ramaswamy and Haley show the GOP’s divergent paths coming out of the debate", "Description": "After her well-received debate showing, Nikki Haley’s campaign worked the phones, collected checks from donors and raised more online in the last 24 hours than on any day since the campaign started, according to an adviser. Onstage the night before, the former U.N. ambassador had positioned herself as the biggest general election threat to Democrats and argued that Donald Trump will be too busy defending himself in court to defeat President Biden.Vivek Ramaswamy was trying to capitalize on his own post-debate buzz. As the fiercest defender of Trump onstage, calling him “the best president of the 21st century,” the 38-year-old first-time candidate and his team looked to expand their support from small-dollar donors and grass-roots Republicans who are drawn to the former president’s combative style and extreme ideas.Their dueling efforts served as an illustration of the chasm in the Republican Party as the underdog candidates labor in Trump’s shadow. The former president skipped Wednesday’s debate, providing an rare spotlight for his rivals. Ramaswamy and Haley offered diverging paths — with the tech entrepreneur promising to lead the party by Trump’s example and with Haley urging a break with the former president while trying to appeal to a broader sector of voters by arguing she is more electable.But the debate did not immediately change their roles as bit players in this drama registering in single digits as Trump dominates the field. So far Republican primary voters haven’t been buying the message that Haley was trying to sell during the debate — that it’s time to move beyond Trump — and Ramaswamy has not made it clear how he would defeat Trump given that much of his success has come from emulating the former president.In that sense, the debate was an event divorced from fundamental reality of the race: that Trump is so far ahead of his rivals that he felt no need to show up in Milwaukee for the debate. And while all the candidates had hoped to bask in the debate afterglow Thursday, attention began shift almost immediately toward the scene surrounding Trump’s surrender at a jail in Fulton County, Ga. — repeating a pattern that has played out many times this year that has appeared to help his standing in the party.The Washington Post, FiveThirtyEight and Ipsos conducted a poll before and after Wednesday night’s debate with potential Republican primary and caucus voters, including those who watched the debate. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis came out slightly on top, with 29 percent of Republican voters who watched the debate saying he performed best. But Ramaswamy was not far back, at 26 percent; and 15 percent called Haley the winner, with other candidates lagging well behind.Haley showed the biggest improvement when it came to the share of Republicans who say they would consider voting for her, while DeSantis, who has been running a distant second to Trump in many polls of the GOP race, but ahead of the rest of the field, made more modest gains. So did Ramaswamy.Some DeSantis allies lamented that Ramaswamy stole the spotlight — as he essentially presented himself as Trump 2.0 — and the former president’s chief defender, which complicated DeSantis’s effort to frame himself as Trump-without-the-baggage. One DeSantis fundraiser conceded that Trump and Ramaswamy were likely the biggest winners, while praising Haley, and said DeSantis “did nothing to hurt or help.”But many DeSantis advisers and donors who had gathered in Milwaukee argued that DeSantis got what he needed by staying above the fray and delivering his core message. Roughly 20 donors worked the phones with DeSantis and his wife, Casey DeSantis, on Thursday, fundraising from Milwaukee and getting a briefing from top campaign advisers they described as upbeat about the debate.Pete Snyder, a former Virginia gubernatorial candidate who helped fundraise, said DeSantis surpassed expectations and that he was “batting .800” as he made calls from a ballroom Thursday – meaning getting donations roughly 8 out of 10 dials.Ramaswamy’s campaign said they were trying to capitalize on a huge surge in search interest on Google to bring new supporters to the campaign. The candidate spent the day reaching out to current and potential supporters through social media — continuing to build trust and conveying to his backers who were instrumental in building the momentum that his campaign is seeing. He also spent time with his kids before addressing a Republican National Committee dinner Thursday night and will head to Iowa to campaign over the next two days.Ramaswamy’s deputy communications director, Stefan Mychajliw, predicted  in Milwaukee that the debate would be like “rocket fuel for Vivek to be clearly in second place in the coming days and weeks ahead.” “The reason why Vivek went from 0.0 percent to where he is right now is the fact that he has an ‘America first’ message,” he added.“Ukraine is not a priority for the United States of America,” Ramaswamy said at one point in the debate.Haley later took direct aim at Ramaswamy, saying, “You have no foreign policy experience, and it shows.”Another Ramaswamy adviser, Tricia McLaughlin, pointed to the attacks from the other candidates — Ramaswamy was a frequent target of criticism onstage Wednesday night — as evidence that “he truly is a real threat to the GOP establishment.”For her part, Haley questioned the merits of talking up the prospect of a strict national abortion ban, as former vice president Mike Pence has done. “No Republican president can ban abortions any more than a Democrat president can ban all those state laws,” Haley said. “Don’t make women feel like they have to decide on this issue when you know we don’t have 60 Senate votes.”She also took on Trump, whom she served under as U.N. ambassador, calling him “the most disliked politician in America.\"Fred Zeidman, a major GOP donor backing Haley, said he’d told her a couple of times: “We need a moment.” She delivered, he said in an interview Thursday after attending the debate: “I really think she put herself in the conversation last night.”After the debate, he headed to the restaurant where Haley and her supporters had gathered and found it was packed. “She obviously had hit a home run,” he said.But both Haley and Ramaswamy were not only contending with Trump and each other. There was DeSantis, who has struggled for months, but drew praise from some donors for his performance. DeSantis appeared tentative or evasive at times in the debate, including when he was slower than others to raise his hand during a question about backing Trump if he won the nomination and was convicted of a crime. Still, some supporters called his performance effective, if not flashy.Jay Zeidman, Fred Zeidman’s son, said his group texts with DeSantis supporters and “like-minded Republicans” lit up with positive feedback Wednesday night. “He didn’t need to come out and look desperate to try to win, like some of the other candidates,” Zeidman said of DeSantis. “He just needed to have this sort of two hours unfiltered access and not be clouded by the shadow of Trump. I think he achieved that.”Roy Bailey, a former national co-chairman of the Trump campaign who is now a major donor to DeSantis and attended the debate, said DeSantis “hit on all the notes.”“He showed his leadership abilities. He showed his executive experience. He was very direct, talking into people’s living room about what he will do on the border, what he will do on crime,” Bailey said. “He stayed out of the finger-wagging NASCAR wreckages that went on and stayed on message and just had a great debate.”DeSantis allies were also pleased by the lack of a breakout moment for Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), since he had been perceived before the debate as one of the strongest challengers vying for the second-place spot occupied by DeSantis.“Tim Scott had been creeping up a little bit in Iowa,” said Hal Lambert, one of the DeSantis donors who helped fundraise post-debate. But at the debate, Lambert said, “it was kind of like was he wasn’t there onstage.”But Matt Gorman, senior communications adviser to Scott, said “too much of the debate was crosstalk and childish exchanges” and that “Tim wasn’t going to waste time with it.”As the candidates who did well raced to use that momentum to fill their coffers Thursday, Rob Godfrey, a South Carolina-based consultant and a former Haley deputy chief of staff (who is neutral in the race), noted where the race goes from here will hinge on whether each campaign has the infrastructure to capitalize on this moment.“While I think a strong debate performance can help any candidate on a variety of fronts, it has to be part of a larger strategy that takes into account everything that it takes to win an election,” he said.Knowles and Wells reported from Milwaukee.

{"id": 94, "Title": "Montgomery students can’t opt out of LGBTQ storybooks, judge says", "Description": "A federal judge Thursday denied a request to let Montgomery County parents pull their children out of the classroom when books with LGBTQ characters are read aloud.Several Muslim and Christian families sued Montgomery County Public Schools in May, saying the use of LGBTQ storybooks forces religious parents to either forgo their beliefs or depart the public school system. They asked to allow their children to opt out of such readings before the school year begins Aug. 28, at least on a temporary basis while litigation over a permanent exemption proceeds.Judge Deborah Boardman of the U.S. District Court for Maryland in Greenbelt said in a 60-page opinion that the parents failed to show that the no-opt-out policy would “result in the indoctrination of their children or otherwise coerce their children to violate or change their religious beliefs.”“With or without an opt-out right, the parents remain free to pursue their sacred obligations to instruct their children in their faiths,” Boardman wrote. “Even if their children’s exposure to religiously offensive ideas makes the parents’ efforts less likely to succeed, that does not amount to a government-imposed burden on their religious exercise.”Last year, the books in question were not mandatory in every class. They accompany a new English language arts curriculum, as entries on a list of recommended readings teachers can draw from as they wish. The list contains titles including “Love, Violet,” a story about a girl who develops a crush on her classmate and contemplates how to create a card for her for Valentine’s Day, and “My Rainbow,” the tale of a mom who makes a colorful wig for her transgender daughter. Montgomery County school officials have said the books are age and developmentally appropriate; they disallowed parents to opt out of the books in March.How the fight against LGBTQ+ books in Montgomery County became a national issueEric Baxter, an attorney representing the religious parents, said the decision was “wrong on multiple levels,” since courts have recognized that “indirect pressure on parents or students to abandon their religious beliefs is sufficient to trigger the First Amendment.” He said the school board has “admitted it is trying to disrupt students understanding … it’s trying to disrupt heteronormativity and cisnormativity.”In Maryland, students are allowed to opt out of certain lessons — specifically the family life and human sexuality curriculum, a unit referenced in the state’s health education framework. Proponents for an opt-out have said the elementary-level books introduce similar topics around sexuality and gender identity and, as such, they should be eligible for the same opt-out.“In our view, it’s absurd that the school board is allowing high school students to opt out of the same material when it’s presented in their health ed classes, but not elementary school kids when it’s presented during story hour,” Baxter said in an interview. He said he will appeal the decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit.Following the Boardman’s decision, Montgomery County Public Schools said in a statement that it “remains committed to cultivating an inclusive and welcoming learning environment and creating opportunities where all students see themselves and their families in curriculum materials.”Instructions to educators that accompanied the curriculum suggested sample language they might use to answer students who objected to the teachings: “I understand that is what you believe, but not everyone believes that. We don’t have to understand or support a person’s identity to treat them with respect and kindness. School is a place where we learn to work together regardless of our differences.”Montgomery County principals concerned over school books with LGBTQ charactersThe argument in the parents’ lawsuit holds that Maryland’s largest school district violated their First Amendment religious freedoms when it blocked an exemption from the readings. During oral arguments over a preliminary injunction this month, their attorneys said the books and their subsequent discussions teach young learners about gender identity and sexuality at a particularly impressionable age — after which parents struggle to convey their own religious values in contradiction of classroom teachings.The school system’s attorneys argued that exposure to the content doesn’t violate the Constitution and that teachers don’t tell students what to believe from the books. They added that opt-outs were previously granted for a variety of reasons — whether political or religious — and, as such, removing the exemptions did not discriminate specifically against religious families.Boardman’s opinion on the injunction was skeptical about the plaintiffs’ religious liberty arguments. “The parents are not pressured into violating their religious beliefs in order to obtain the benefits of a public education,” she wrote.Thursday’s ruling does not amount to a final determination about the case, but Boardman signaled she could not grant an injunction, because “the plaintiffs’ free exercise claims are not likely to succeed on the merits.”Hours before Boardman issued her opinion, several students, parents and community members spoke at a school board meeting both against and for an opt-out — even though the topic wasn’t on the agenda. For months, hundreds of Muslim and Christian parents have routinely demonstrated outside of school board meetings, protesting what they say are infringements upon their First Amendment rights to avoid the content of LGBTQ books.When the order was issued Thursday, most demonstrators had left the school board meeting, but there were extra police officers and school security around the building’s front doors.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/08/24/montgomery-students-cant-opt-out-lgbtq-storybooks-judge-says/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 24, 2023", "Tag": "International political", "Keywords": "LGBTQ+ books, religious beliefs, opt-out policy."}
{"id": 95, "Title": "Ratings for first Republican debate of 2024 couldn’t compare with 2016", "Description": "Roughly 12.8 million people watched the Republican primary debate on Fox News on Wednesday night — in line with expectations that the first debate of the 2024 presidential cycle would fall far short of the 24 million people who watched the comparable election-season kickoff eight years ago.The Milwaukee debate featured more than a few compelling moments, including frequent clashes between newcomer Vivek Ramaswamy and his opponents, most notably former president Mike Pence and former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley. But it was no comparison, ratings-wise, to the 2015 event that featured the debate debut of Donald Trump. The reliable ratings magnet is running again, but he sat out Wednesday night’s event in favor of a pretaped Twitter interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.Meanwhile, television viewership has broadly fallen off over the past decade, as fewer people are paying for and watching cable news.Still, the network said, this week’s debate was the most-watched non-sports cable broadcast of the year.In an interview ahead of the debate, co-moderator Bret Baier acknowledged that Trump’s presence might have increased viewership. “I think people who are ready to tune in to politics are going to tune in,” he said. “If the former president is on the stage, clearly numbers go up.”Instead, Carlson posted his video interview with Trump on the social media platform X, previously known as Twitter, five minutes before the debate broadcast started.Trump nodded to the counterprogramming strategy in his conversation with Carlson. “We’ll get bigger ratings using this crazy forum you’re using than probably the debate,” he said.Trump’s prediction is impossible to verify. As of Thursday evening, the 46-minute-long video had more than 238 million “views,” but the platform’s standard for viewership is in no way comparable to the way that Nielsen — the gold standard for television measurement — tracks audience. The company now known as X acknowledges that a view can be triggered when a user sees a video for two seconds, even if they don’t watch it. Nielsen’s numbers are an extrapolation drawn from the average number of people watching a television show during one minute of programming.Fox News has felt Trump’s absence before. In January 2016, when Trump withdrew at the last minute from a Fox-hosted debate ahead of the Iowa caucuses, the event was watched by 12.5 million people, a big drop from the first debate of the cycle and lower than the average of 15.5 million viewers who watched the 12 GOP primary debates that cycle.Television industry veterans and academics said the debate was watchable, if not a barnburner.At times, Baier and co-moderator Martha MacCallum stepped in to calm the crowd and, at one point, to urge Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to answer a question about whether Pence “did the right thing” on Jan. 6, 2021, when the former vice president presided over Congress’s certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory. At another point, Haley called on the Fox moderators to regain control of the event.“I thought it was arguably more interesting than many of these early season ‘cattle call’ events have been in past cycles,” said Mark Lukasiewicz, a former NBC News executive who now runs Hofstra University’s school of communication. “Although the moderators lost control more than once, there were real and substantive exchanges and differences.”Robert Thompson, director of Syracuse University’s Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture, agreed. “It delivered as a dramatic event,” he said. He attributed the lower ratings to “casting,” arguing that Trump’s presence certainly would have boosted eyeballs.Mark Feldstein, a veteran CNN journalist who now teaches at the University of Maryland, felt differently about the broadcast, which he called “a snoozer.”“Last night’s debate will only serve to create more buildup for Trump when he does show, the better to steal the thunder — and goose the ratings — as usual,” Feldstein said.The next debate is also in the Fox family, to be hosted by Fox Business Network on Sept. 27 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. Once again, Trump’s potential attendance is sure to be the major storyline ahead of the debate.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/08/24/republican-debate-ratings-fox-news-2024/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 24, 2023", "Tag": "International political", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 96, "Title": "For every six Republican debate-watchers, one watched Trump instead", "Description": "Former president Donald Trump is very excited about the success of his conversation with Tucker Carlson at attracting attention. Over on Truth Social, the social media network created by and for Donald Trump, he touted that the interview posted on X, the social media network renamed by and for Elon Musk, had “231,000,000 Views, and still counting.” This, he said, made it the “Biggest Video on Social Media, EVER, more than double the Super Bowl!”This is not true, which perhaps you suspected, coming from the biggest-inaugural-crowd-ever guy. As The Washington Post’s Will Oremus explained Wednesday evening, that figure includes any view of the post containing the video, not the video itself. And even if it were “views” of the video, X only requires that people view a few seconds of video for a “view” to be counted.Trump’s goal, of course, is to suggest that he is a far bigger draw than the Republican presidential primary debate that was underway when the Carlson conversation was published. (Perhaps you suspected this, coming from the my-inaugural-crowd-was-bigger-than-Obama’s guy.) But polling conducted by Ipsos for The Post and FiveThirtyEight suggests that likely Republican primary voters were quite a bit more likely to tune into the debate.Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpOverall, most of that pool of likely primary voters watched neither. About two-thirds of those included in our poll reported not tuning in to the debate, even in part. (The other third was about evenly split between those who watched the whole thing and those who only watched a bit of it.) Within that two-thirds who didn’t watch, 7 percent reported watching Trump and Carlson instead. That’s about 5 percent of the total.So for every three people who watched the whole debate, one watched Trump-Tucker.One might suspect that those who watched Trump’s conversation with Carlson were more fervent supporters of the president. One would be correct. Within that subgroup, about 9 in 10 had previously reported viewing Trump favorably, with 85 percent of the group viewing him very favorably. Among those who didn’t watch the debate, about 6 in 10 viewed him favorably, the same as the group who did watch at least some of the debate.Your next thought, then, might be that those Trump superfans simply said they watched the conversation with Carlson even when they didn’t. And that’s certainly possible. But remember that Trump is polling over 50 percent in national primary polling, meaning that having one-tenth of that figure say they watched his counterprogramming really isn’t very impressive.What’s more, about four times as many respondents said they spent the time watching something else on TV or watched a movie. In other words, given a number of choices for what they were doing, a lot of people simply fessed up to not watching anything political. And even more copped to watching nothing at all. More than twice as many respondents said they slept as said they watched Trump talk to Carlson.The former president would probably take these numbers and try to brag about how he got one viewer for every three people who watched the whole debate (or for every six who watched part of it, but he would not use that number). Remember, though, that our poll, like X’s metrics, don’t demand that someone watched the whole conversation. Some portion of the 5 percent who tuned in to Trump didn’t actually watch much of it.Personally, I watched all of both. I am what’s known as “an outlier.”Emily Guskin contributed to this report.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/24/every-six-republican-debate-watchers-one-watched-trump-instead/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 24, 2023", "Tag": "International political", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 97, "Title": "It wasn’t just his personality that prompted those attacks on Ramaswamy", "Description": "A Washington Post analysis put numbers behind a pattern that would have been apparent to anyone watching Wednesday night’s first debate of the 2024 Republican presidential nominating contest. It was, in fact, Vivek Ramaswamy who drew the most attacks from the other candidates on the stage.In part, this was because he tacitly encouraged them to do so. His approach to his campaign from the outset has been to differentiate himself by championing the aggressive, confrontational rhetoric of the right-wing fringe, a tendency that contributes to criticisms that he’s merely parroting the front-runner, Donald Trump. It’s often actually the case that both candidates are saying the stuff the fringe-right is saying rather than Ramaswamy following Trump’s lead.But in part the attacks on Ramaswamy had a more tactical intent. He’s not leading in polling by any stretch; that, again, is Trump. He’s not even in second place, a position held by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. But he is in third place and rising — while DeSantis’s position is slipping.Instead of beating the dead horse, one might think, it’s better to throw obstacles in front of the one who’s gaining.Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpThis surge by Ramaswamy is relatively recent, but it’s real. Over the course of the year, FiveThirtyEight’s polling average shows the contest going from a two-man, Trump-DeSantis contest — with Ramaswamy undeclared and absent from polling — to a robust Trump lead and a two-man race for second.A month ago, FiveThirtyEight had Trump at 50 percent, DeSantis at 24 and Ramaswamy at 3. Now, Trump’s at 52 percent, DeSantis at 15 and Ramaswamy at 10. Ramaswamy has closed 16 points of the 21-point gap that existed on July 24.Yahoo News polling conducted by YouGov shows where those shifts have occurred. At the beginning of the year, DeSantis was the preferred candidate of more moderate likely Republican primary voters, including independents who vote Republican. Now, Ramaswamy leads with that group. DeSantis was also running closely with Trump among likely primary voters with a college degree. His support with that group has collapsed.This doesn’t mean that Ramaswamy is on a trajectory to overtake Trump, certainly. It does mean, though, that he’s doing the one thing that every person on that debate stage wants to do: He’s gaining ground.It’s not clear how DeSantis’s trajectory in the opposite direction can be halted. His strength earlier this year was predicated to a large extent on his being seen as the guy who could surpass Trump in primary voting if the anti-Trump vote coalesced around him. That strategy depended to some extent on his continuing to present a real challenge to Trump, spurring other candidates not to enter the race or spurring donors and endorsers to rally around him. But that didn’t happen immediately and, once his campaign announcement failed to trigger a flurry of enthusiasm, there was a disincentive for it to happen at all. No one wants to go all in on the guy who’s collapsing — especially if the only reason you’re supporting the guy is because he was supposedly the sole threat to Trump.What the people on the stage were battling for was less the party’s nomination than to be the preferred alternative to Trump. It seems increasingly obvious that this will not be DeSantis. Meanwhile, Ramaswamy is making moves. So that’s where you target your energy.That his approach to the debate was to be intentionally obnoxious to his opponents simply made that targeting easier to implement.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/24/it-wasnt-just-his-personality-that-prompted-those-attacks-ramaswamy/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 24, 2023", "Tag": "International political", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 99, "Title": "Some undersold moments from the first Republican debate", "Description": "The dust has settled on the first Republican debate of the 2024 presidential nominating contest. We recapped some of the big storylines and moments here.But the two-hour debate also featured some exchanges that flew somewhat under the radar and deserve some reflection.Below, we look at a few.Perhaps the biggest story of the debate was the emergence of Vivek Ramaswamy as the center of attention. Nobody’s performance shuffled expectations — for good or ill — as much as his did.Among his characteristically absolutist proclamations was this particularly stark one:“Let us be honest as Republicans,” Ramaswamy said as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis talked around a climate-change question. “I’m the only person on the stage who isn’t bought and paid for, so I can say this: The climate change agenda is a hoax.”Someone said, “Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.” Another added: “That is ridiculous.” A fair number of boos rained down.It was an angle to be expected from the most inexperienced politician on the stage, but perhaps not to that degree. He was saying that seven of the top nine candidates for the GOP nomination — former president Donald Trump skipped the debate — were “bought and paid for.”Ramaswamy is the kind of candidate who, while probably having little hope of winning, seems primed to gain a significant following in the Trumpian GOP. And to the extent that he’s convincing people that so many of the party’s leaders are compromised, that’s not a great development for the party.Fox News’s moderators followed up Ramaswamy’s bold claim by helpfully asking the candidates whether they were indeed “bought and paid for.” Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) responded by errantly saying, “Absolutely,” before correcting himself with an “Absolutely not” after a moderator asked again. Later, Ramaswamy congratulated former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley on her “future career on the boards of Lockheed and Raytheon.”DeSantis objected to the climate-change question because the candidates were asked for a show of hands, and then when pressed he didn’t take a firm position. It wasn’t the only time he tried to avoid a direct answer. Asked twice about a federal abortion ban, he said merely, “I’m going to stand on the side of life.”When the topic turned to whether then-Vice President Mike Pence had done the right thing on Jan. 6, 2021, by not trying to overturn the election, DeSantis was especially squeamish.Behold:The moderators soon, to their credit, forced the issue by inviting Pence himself to weigh in:Bookending this exchange were multiple GOP candidates offering flat and unequivocal answers — Pence had done the right thing. Pence’s decision not to try to overturn a presidential election was consequential; it’s hard to argue that it wasn’t worth commenting on. Pence himself drove that home and forced the issue.Soon after, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie knocked DeSantis for offering only a “grudging” endorsement of what Pence did.Pence has dealt gingerly with Trump’s legal jeopardy. But one answer Wednesday stood out.Ramaswamy decided to ask whether Pence — the man whom some Jan. 6 rioters chanted about hanging as Trump was attacking him on Twitter — would pardon Trump.Pence demurred, but he also made a conspicuous reference to “contrition”:It’s difficult to understand this as anything other than a very personal response. Trump not only turned much of the Republican Party against Pence — efforts that still dog Pence’s 2024 chances — but he also has expressed no real regret for what Pence has cast as having “endangered my family.” Trump has even blamed Pence for the violence that day.We touched on this in our winners and losers roundup. But it’s worth emphasizing the degree to which Haley undermined the GOP’s complaints about Democratic spending.Here are her key comments:Like Ramaswamy with his “bought and paid for” remark, Haley opted for an angle that might be advantageous for the candidate in the moment. But it undercuts her party in a significant way.

{"id": 100, "Title": "‘Abortion until the day of birth’ is evocative — but misleading", "Description": "There were a range of positions on abortion displayed during the first Republican presidential primary debate on Wednesday, though all leaned toward more restrictions rather than fewer. It’s an issue that has long been an understandable trigger for political debate, but also one with renewed salience since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.As debate moderator Martha MacCallum noted, a number of recent ballot initiatives centered on abortion have seen the side supporting abortion access be victorious. In response, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley asked her peers to “stop demonizing this issue,” a recognition that a push for a hard-line position on the issue was a political loser for her party.But she was in the minority, and not just because of her gender. Others onstage called for strict limits on access, at times deploying a favorite bit of hyperbole to do so.Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip Bump“What the Democrats are trying to do on this issue is wrong, to allow abortion all the way up to the moment of birth,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said. He’s signed a law in his state banning abortion past six weeks of pregnancy.Sen. Tim Scott, also of South Carolina, said something similar.“We cannot let states like California, New York and Illinois have abortions on demand up until the day of birth,” Scott warned. “That is immoral. It is unethical. It is wrong.”The crowd applauded, which was the point. Framing the issue of abortion not as access-vs.-no-access but, instead as for-or-against-murdering-near-newborns provides a much easier point from which to defend restrictions on the practice. The Democrats want to kill kids just before they’re born! Vote Republican.But this is misleading, if not — as in Scott’s presentation — flatly incorrect.There are states in which there are no limits on the point of a pregnancy when abortion is available. MacCallum, asking a related question of North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, pointed to New Jersey as an example. Others, according to research from the Guttmacher Institute, include New Mexico, Oregon and Colorado. But that doesn’t mean that a woman can simply walk into a facility at her 40th week and request an abortion. Instead, as PolitiFact wrote when considering this question last year, such procedures “are performed on a case-by-case basis when there are maternal or fetal complications.”Importantly, even abortions performed after 20 weeks are rare. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects data on abortions conducted in the United States, the most recent data for which cover 2020, before the reversal of Roe. That year, less than 1 percent of abortions were performed later than 20 weeks into a pregnancy. Eight in 10 were performed before the 10th week. In New Jersey, less than 2 percent of procedures were conducted after the 20th week.New York, California and Illinois all have statutory limits on when an abortion can be performed, contrary to Scott’s framing. It is true that an abortion can be performed later than the established limit in New York, but only if the mother’s life is at risk or the fetus isn’t viable. It is not the case that a New Yorker can simply walk into a clinic at any point in a pregnancy and demand an abortion. The number of abortions that are conducted late in pregnancy across the country is very small, though not zero.The CDC data offers a lens into other aspects of abortion. About 1 in 8 abortions in 2020, for example, was performed on a married mother. Most abortions that year were also the recipient’s first; about 2 in 5 recipients were known to have previously had an abortion.The most common age range in which abortions were performed that year was when the mother was between 20 and 29. Only 0.2 percent of abortions in 2020 were performed on mothers under the age of 15.One of the divides that emerged during the Republican debate centered on the point at which abortion should be allowed. Even former vice president Mike Pence, who framed the issue in overtly religious terms, supported a ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy.That’s the appeal of the “until the moment of birth” rhetoric. Not only does it frame Democrats as demented monsters, it allows Republican candidates to endorse a hard limit on abortion — and therefore sidestep the need to draw a more precise line in the sand.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/24/republicans-abortion-roe/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 24, 2023", "Tag": "International political", "Keywords": "Abortion, Republican primary debate, restrictions."}
{"id": 101, "Title": "Vivek Ramaswamy cribs Obama’s famous ‘funny name’ line in GOP debate", "Description": "Zingers and barbs flew across the stage during Wednesday night’s Republican primary debate in Milwaukee, but one of the most attention-grabbing candidate quotes wasn’t even an attack.Vivek Ramaswamy, the 38-year-old former biotech executive turned political newcomer, said what he imagined many viewers were thinking when they saw him: “Who the heck is this skinny guy with a funny last name and what the heck is he doing in the middle of this debate stage?”If the line sounded familiar, it was because Barack Obama said nearly the same thing 19 years ago.The future president, then an Illinois state senator, was tapped to give the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. The 17-minute speech, widely considered Obama’s political breakout moment, included a line about the transformational and inclusive power of hope that cut across generations and personal experiences, including his own. It was, as Obama said, “the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too.”Ramaswamy’s campaign didn’t immediately respond to questions Thursday about why the Republican candidate invoked Obama on the debate stage.The line came after Fox News moderator Bret Baier asked Ramaswamy why voters should choose Ramaswamy over better-known candidates. Afterward, rivals like former New Jersey governor Chris Christie seized on the  link to Obama.“The last person who stood up here saying, ‘What’s a skinny guy with an odd last name doing up here?’ was Barack Obama, and I’m afraid we’re dealing with the same type of amateur standing on the stage tonight,” Christie said.Following the Wednesday debate, Ramaswamy’s deputy communications director, Stefan Mychajliw, told The Washington Post: “Our candidate’s not the one that wrapped their arm around Barack Obama. Chris Christie was.”The reference was to a 2012 photo that’s been a recurring political headache for Christie: The then-governor of New Jersey is seen greeting the president on a tarmac in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy’s destruction and shaking his hand as Obama places his other hand on Christie’s shoulder.Still, Ramaswamy’s decision to invoke a two-term Democratic president on a stage full of Republicans was an unusual choice for a candidate whose style and rhetoric in many ways hew closer to a different former president: Donald Trump.Ramaswamy claimed climate change was a “hoax” (evidence and broad scientific consensus concur it is not) and vowed as president to stop funding Ukraine’s defense against Russia. They were the kind of fringe right-wing positions that made most of his fellow Republicans onstage balk — and bore striking similarity to how Trump as a political newcomer in 2015 embraced shocking or outrageous positions to make himself the center of attention, The Post’s Philip Bump noted in his analysis of the debate.The move clearly paid off for Trump, and it appears to have worked for Ramaswamy as well. On Thursday morning, he was the candidate everyone was talking about.Dylan Wells contributed to this report.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/24/ramaswamy-obama-line-gop-debate/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 24, 2023", "Tag": "International political", "Keywords": "1.

What to expect next round.", "Description": "With the first Republican primary debate barely in the rearview mirror, some political junkies are already anticipating the next time the presidential hopefuls will face off.It won’t be a long wait: The 2024 candidates are scheduled to take the stage again Sept. 27 — this time at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Southern California.The eight contenders who debated Wednesday, however, will have to clear a higher bar to participate next time.Candidates had to have at least 40,000 donors and reach at least 1 percent in qualifying polls to make the first debate stage, under Republican National Committee rules. To appear in Simi Valley, Calif., the RNC requires them to get 50,000 donors and hit at least 3 percent in two national polls, or 3 percent in one national poll and two polls from separate early-nominating states.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former vice president Mike Pence, Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.), former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley and former New Jersey governor Chris Christie are all at or above 3 percent in a Washington Post average of August polling.Two others who made the stage Wednesday night — Former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum — risk missing the mark.Trump gambles on finding strength in indictments instead of debateFormer president Donald Trump, the primary’s front-runner, also may not participate in the second debate, which will air on Fox Business, Univision and Rumble. Trump, who is polling more than 35 percentage points ahead of the next candidate, skipped the first faceoff and has said he plans to skip others.“I’m leading by 50 and 60 points, and some of them are at 1 and zero and 2 [percent], and I’m saying, do I sit there for an hour or two hours, whatever it’s going to be, and get harassed by people that shouldn’t even be running for president?” Trump told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in an interview released as the debate began.The Republican contenders targeted each other Wednesday as much as they went after Trump in absentia. Several of the most heated exchanges centered on Ramaswamy, a 38-year-old political novice who sparred with some of the more experienced candidates. Ramaswamy attacked his rivals as “super PAC puppets,” while Pence called him a “rookie” and Christie labeled him an “amateur.”One of the most striking moments of the night came when the debate moderators, Fox News hosts Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, asked the candidates to raise their hands if they would support Trump if he won the nomination and was convicted of a crime.All but two of the eight contenders — Hutchinson and Christie — clearly raised their hands.Michael Scherer contributed to this report.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/24/second-republican-debate/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 24, 2023", "Tag": "International political", "Keywords": "1.

{"id": 103, "Title": "Vivek Ramaswamy makes an impression at one New Hampshire debate watch party", "Description": "MANCHESTER, N.H. — Zach Hayes did not know much about businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, repeatedly mispronouncing his first name, but had seen a few videos online of him on the campaign trail and was eager to see how he would perform in the first debate of the Republican presidential primary.By the end of the night, Hayes was pronouncing the political newcomer’s name correctly and praising him as the winner of the Wednesday night debate.“I agree with a lot of what he says. I’m excited to see how he progresses,” said Hayes, 39, a software engineer.Hayes joined more than 60 Republican voters here in the first-in-the-nation primary state for a watch party hosted by Americans for Prosperity, the network of donors and activist groups led by the conservative billionaire Charles Koch. The group is explicitly opposing the candidacy of former president Donald Trump but says it has not yet endorsed a candidate.After a night of sipping beers and eating fried mozzarella sticks at Murphy’s Taproom, a pub in downtown, it became clear that many voters who attended the event felt the same as Hayes: Ramaswamy captured their attention, making an early and strong impression against more experienced political figures, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who many thought would have garnered more of a spotlight during the two-hour debate.Still, voters left the party mostly undecided about whom they ultimately would support in the primary early next year. Several said that it was still early in the cycle and that they were weighing their options, including Trump, the GOP front-runner, who was not on the stage.Greg Moore, the state director for Americans for Prosperity in New Hampshire, kicked off the event by asking attendees whether they had already settled on their candidates. A handful raised their hands. A few signaled that they were undecided. And a majority in the room shot up their hands to indicate that they had narrowed their picks to two or three candidates.Ken Biel, 47, started the night naming Ramaswamy and DeSantis as his two favored candidates. Both remained his favorites after the debate. He thought Ramaswamy showed that he has good ideas and is quick on his feet. DeSantis, he thought, did better than expected, given the challenges his campaign has had since its launch, including criticism of the Florida governor’s awkwardness when interacting with voters on the trail and his move to cut more than one-third of the campaign staff.But Biel is still figuring out how both candidates would fare against Trump.“If it’s a choice between him and DeSantis or Vivek or somebody else, I’m still kind of up in the air about that,” said Biel, who voted for Trump twice and said he would vote for him again if he were the party’s nominee. “Nobody’s voting for him on policy. If I voted for him, it wouldn’t be on policy.”Biel, who said he thought Washington had become “too powerful and too central to our lives,” also said he has always appreciated Trump’s going against the establishment.Hayes, who moved here last year from Oregon, said he was not sure what he would do if Trump won the nomination. In 2016 and 2020, he said, he voted for third-party candidates. He said that he would prefer Trump to President Biden right now but that in a repeat matchup he was not sure whether he would pick one of the two, go for a third-party candidate or sit out the election.Biel added that he felt putting Trump back in office would be “more chaotic” than electing someone like Ramaswamy, who was “more thoughtful.” He left the event leaning toward Ramaswamy — as did Hayes, whom Biel met at the watch party and with whom he ended up sharing a table.Biel said he found it notable that the other candidates did not attack DeSantis, who, going into the debate, was ranked second in polls, and instead focused their criticisms on Ramaswamy.“It tells you the other candidates don’t see [DeSantis] as a threat,” said Biel, a software engineer who brought his teenage daughter to the event. “They could have attacked some of his policies in Florida. There’s so much they could have done. It tells me they don’t see him as a threat right now, but maybe that could change.”Ramaswamy might have generated buzz in the room, but not everyone was impressed with his performance. Jaime Prout, 35, listened closely to the candidates’ responses as she played debate bingo with her husband beside her and won.“I think Vivek just likes to hear himself speak and doesn’t really have a logical opinion,” Prout, a molecular geneticist, said after the debate.Instead, she is all in for Nikki Haley, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, calling her the “calm voice of reason among all the bickering” in the debate.Prout, a mother of four, said she supports abortion rights. Although Haley describes herself as pro-life, Prout said the former South Carolina governor was the only candidate who was open-minded on the issue. During the debate, Haley argued that Republicans should work to find a consensus and “stop demonizing this issue.”Prout shook her head repeatedly as she watched DeSantis and Pence talk about their strict stances against abortion.Prout said she never voted for Trump and would not be voting for him in 2024 if he were the nominee.“I would vote for a third party if there was a good candidate, or I wouldn’t vote for president,” Prout said. “I just will not vote. I don’t believe in voting for the lesser of two evils.”Victoria Sullivan, who is in her 50s, was not ready to back a candidate in the Republican presidential primary after just one debate. But she said she did think there was a clear candidate to watch: Ramaswamy.“He’s very bold in what he believes in. He’s not wishy-washy or backing down, and I think that’s a part of Trump that a lot of people were drawn to,” she said, adding that Ramaswamy has the added advantage of being young, given that voters are tired of seeing old politicians.“He’s fresh out of the gate,” she added.Going into the debate, she was looking for who could be an alternative to Trump.“We don’t know if President Trump will be a viable candidate down the road, so I think that each candidate needs to concentrate on their message and bring it to the American people,” said Sullivan, who works in education.She floated the idea of Ramaswamy and Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) on the GOP ticket together.Sullivan did not think Trump would have benefited from attending the debate. The ritual made more sense for the other candidates, who are trying to elevate their standings, but in the former president’s case “everyone already knows who Donald Trump is and what he stands for.”Alicia Lekas, 67, was an early supporter of DeSantis, viewing him as the most likely to beat Trump. She said she liked a lot of what he has done in Florida, particularly his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.“I’m not so sure now,” she said after the debate, which she said Ramaswamy clearly won.“If Trump gets the nomination, I think that’s bad for our state,” Lekas, a Republican state representative, said. “Looking at the way voters vote in New Hampshire, I think it would be bad down the ballot — and that’s what I’m concerned about.”She views Ramaswamy and DeSantis as the candidates with the best chance of beating Trump.“Can Trump be beat? I don’t know,” she said, wearing a top with the American flag. “But I gotta support whoever I think is most likely.” She had hoped Trump would not run again, but if he were the nominee, she would support him, she said.For Norm Olsen, 71, the debate was about seeing who could really compete against Trump as the race heats up. Olsen said he has been against Trump since his first presidential bid. He said he voted for libertarian candidates in 2016 and 2020 and is convinced that the former president cannot win in 2024.“He can’t win. He’s lost. He’ll lose the presidency. Republicans would not gain the Senate, they may lose the House, and it may affect governors’ races if he is on the top of the ticket,” said Olsen, a technology consultant. “So, from a conservative standpoint, from a moderate standpoint, from a Republican standpoint, Trump really should not be on that ticket.”Sporting a ‘No Trump’ button, Olsen said he was pleased that Trump was not at the debate because it would have been “dominated by him” at a time when the other candidates “need more attention.”As he sipped his beer, Olsen offered his assessment of the field: Ramaswamy has been a “surprise” and brings a good background to the race; Haley has “great international experience,” and DeSantis has a good record in Florida.“I’d like to see one or two of them step forward and really be able to give Trump some competition,” Olsen said. “Some need to bow out already. But we’ve got to get one of these guys.”", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/24/vivek-ramaswamy-debate-new-hampshire-watch/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 24, 2023", "Tag": "International political", "Keywords": "Zach Hayes, Vivek Ramaswamy, Republican primary."}
{"id": 104, "Title": "Republican rivals clash sharply in combative debate with no Trump", "Description": "MILWAUKEE — Republican presidential contenders targeted each other Wednesday as much as they did the absent front-runner, Donald Trump, in a combative first debate with a series of heated clashes reflecting the fierce competition to emerge as the main alternative to the former president.Trump’s decision to skip the event, a choice that highlighted his commanding polling lead, left him without a defense over two hours that marked the official start of the nomination battle. His biggest consolation came when all but two of the candidates onstage clearly raised their hands to signal that they would support Trump if he won the nomination and was convicted of a crime in a court of law. Trump has been indicted four times and faces 91 criminal charges and will surrender in Georgia on Thursday.But the debate more often pivoted around other fiery exchanges between candidates who are seeking to differentiate themselves, including several involving entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who has risen in some polls and appeared to irritate other candidates onstage. The first-time millennial candidate is casting his candidacy as a next iteration of Trump and got into tense back-and-forths with more experienced politicians, including former vice president Mike Pence, former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley and former New Jersey governor Chris Christie.He aggressively attacked his rivals on the stage from the start, describing them as “super PAC puppets” and  “professional politicians” who were “bought and paid for.”“I’ve had enough already tonight of a guy who sounds like ChatGPT standing up here,” Christie said in response. “The last person in one of these debates … who stood in the middle of the stage and said what’s a skinny guy with an odd last name doing up here was Barack Obama, and I’m afraid we’re dealing with the same type of amateur standing on the stage tonight.”A noticeably combative Pence, who repeatedly talked over the moderators’ pleas to abide by time limits and went directly after several rivals, took aim at Ramaswamy’s lack of political experience, saying that “now is not the time for on-the-job training” and that “we don’t need to bring in a rookie.”Much of the debate onstage was not about policy but about each candidate’s personal characteristics and experience. And for large portions, the candidates largely ignored Trump — though some of them criticized him on particular issues.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis with a fiery demeanor attacked Trump for agreeing to lock down the country during the pandemic on the advice of former White House medical adviser Anthony S. Fauci. Trump allies have noted repeatedly that DeSantis praised Fauci early in the pandemic as well.“I will never let the deep state bureaucrats lock you down. You don’t take somebody like Fauci and coddle him. You bring Fauci in, you sit him down, and you say: Anthony, you are fired,” DeSantis said.Haley blamed Trump for failing to rein in spending. “Donald Trump added $8 trillion to our debt, and our kids are never going to forgive us,” she said. Later in the debate, she called Trump “the most disliked politician in America,” drawing some boos. “We can’t win a general election that way,” Haley said, calling for a “new generation.”At points, the crowd stepped in to defend the former president, booing Christie audibly when he denounced Trump’s “conduct.”“This is the great thing about this country — booing is allowed, but it doesn’t change the truth,” Christie said, as the crowd continued to boo.To the surprise of some DeSantis foes and supporters, his rivals largely avoided attacking him. DeSantis, who has lost traction over the summer but remains Trump’s closest competitor in national polls, hit many of the talking points he has used on the campaign trail, attacking liberal overreach, recounting his successes in Florida and calling for an end to the “weaponization” of federal law enforcement against Republicans.His rivals, however, mostly avoided direct conflict with him, choosing to duel with each other over policy, or to joust with Ramaswamy.“Vivek, you recently said that a president can’t do everything. Well I’ve got news for you, Vivek,” Pence said. “I’ve been in a hallway, I’ve been in the West Wing, the president of the United States has to confront every crisis facing America.”One of the debate’s defining moments came when Fox News moderator Bret Baier directly asked the candidates if they would support “the elephant not in the room” if he was convicted in a court of law. With some delay, all of the candidates onstage, except former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson, raised their hand. Christie waved a finger but then clarified that he did not approve of Trump’s conduct and the party needed to move on. DeSantis looked around and was among the last to raise his hand.Hutchinson suggested that Trump was disqualified under the “insurrection clause” of the U.S. Constitution. “I am not going to support somebody who has been convicted of a felony or has been disqualified by the U.S. Constitution,” he said.Many of the candidates onstage, including Christie, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Haley also praised Pence for refusing Trump’s demands to reject presidential electors following the 2020 election. DeSantis initially refused to answer the direct question, arguing that it looked backward in a way that would benefit Democrats.“Mike did his duty. I’ve got no beef with him,” DeSantis later said, after Pence demanded that he answer.“He asked me to put him over the constitution, and I chose the constitution,” Pence said, who kept talking about Jan. 6 as the moderators and other candidates attempted to move on.Ramaswamy was the most defensive of Trump, saying that others should pardon him and defending Trump’s foreign policy positions.The debate marked the end of the 2024 campaign’s preseason, a months-long sprint through fundraisers, town halls and early-state fried food that has so far been overshadowed by the former president’s mounting legal troubles and continued knack for channeling his party’s bubbling frustration with the nation’s plight.For each of the candidates, the event long loomed as a pivotal strategic moment, promising a chance to demonstrate their presidential mettle, establish their contrasting vision and introduce themselves to a primary electorate that has yet to fully engage with the presidential contest.Haley, whose campaign has yet to gain traction, leaned into her foreign policy experience and engaged in back and forth exchanges with the other contenders on the stage, including Pence, Ramaswamy and DeSantis. At one point she also told the moderators they needed to “get control of this debate.” In another moment, she took a shot at Ramaswamy, telling him: \"You have no foreign policy experience and it shows.” She also at times offered criticism of her own party, including on the federal deficit.And Haley emphasized her role as the only woman on the stage. “If you want something said, ask a man. If you want something done, ask a woman,” she said.North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Hutchinson, who had hoped the debate would give them much needed exposure, spent must of the debate off-screen as their more well-known rivals squabbled. Scott doubled down on his campaign approach, offering an optimistic, more softly spoken vision, but was silent for long stretches of the debate.There were some policy differences in the debate, particularly on Ukraine and abortion. The candidates split on their commitment to more funding for the war to push back Russia’s invasion. Pence, Haley and Christie firmly sided with further support, while Ramaswamy objected and DeSantis called for European countries to pick up more of the bill.“The reality is that today Ukraine is not a priority for the United States of America,” Ramaswamy said. “You cannot start another no-win war.”Haley responded sharply. “Ukraine is the first line of defense for us, and the problem that Vivek doesn’t understand is he wants to hand Ukraine to Russia, he wants to let China eat Taiwan, he wants to go and stop funding Israel,” she said. “You don’t do that to friends.”When it came to abortion, Pence, who has challenged the other Republican contenders to back a 15-week abortion ban as a minimum standard, took a shot at Haley’s call for a consensus on abortion, telling the former U.N. ambassador that “consensus is the opposite of leadership.”“When the Supreme Court returned this question to the American people, they didn’t just send it to the states only,” Pence said. “It’s not a states-only issue. It’s a moral issue.”Haley responded that it was time to “be honest with the American people,” noting there aren’t sufficient votes in the Senate for a federal abortion ban to pass.“No Republican president can ban abortions any more than a Democrat president can ban all those state laws,” Haley said. “Don’t make women feel like they have to decide on this issue when you know we don’t have 60 Senate votes.”Trump, who had long signaled he would not participate in the debate and made his decision official in recent days, sat for an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that published online just before the debate started.In the interview, Trump suggested that the United States could see more political violence.“I don’t know. There’s a level of passion that I’ve never seen,” Trump said, when asked if the country is headed to open conflict. “There’s a level of hatred that I’ve never seen. And that’s probably a bad combination.”Though Trump was not onstage, his advisers were present at the event, training their fire on DeSantis. “Ron DeSanctimonious’s campaign died tonight as he was leapfrogged by Vivek Ramaswamy. He needed a breakout performance, and he failed,” said Jason Miller, a spokesman for Trump.The Republican National Committee required candidates to have at least 40,000 donors and to hit at least one 1 percent in qualifying national and state polls to make the first debate stage.To qualify for the second debate, on Sept. 27 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., they will need to get 50,000 donors and hit at least 3 percent in two national polls, or 3 percent in one national poll and 3 percent in two polls conducted from separate early-nominating states.Scherer and LeVine reported from Washington.A previous version of this story incorrectly said all but one of the candidates raised their hands to signal they would support Trump if he won the nomination and was convicted of a crime. All but two clearly did so.

{"id": 105, "Title": "Tucker did his best to drag Trump into his political violence fantasies", "Description": "If you set aside those occasions in which Tucker Carlson probed for more information in response to something that Donald Trump said, the former Fox News host asked the former president 10 questions during their conversation published on social media Wednesday evening.That conversation was predicated on the two formers sticking a thumb in the eye of their opponents. Carlson was hoping to peel viewership and clout away from Fox, the channel that was hosting the first Republican presidential debate. Trump was hoping to demonstrate that he was above the whole thing. Carlson’s first question centered on this intent: Why wasn’t Trump at the debate?Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpThe response was what you’d expect, with Trump using the moment to chide Fox News for what he has argued is its unfair treatment of his bid for reelection. Carlson, mustering his well-practiced objective-observer persona, probed a little further: Did Trump “think television is declining?”Both Carlson, host of “Tucker on X,” (X being the new name for Twitter) and Trump had a reason to suggest that television was on a downslope, of course, at least relative to the sporadic posting of videos on social media. The bigger the thumb, the more damage to the eye. Trump would soon post a performatively amazed comment about the scale of viewership — the interview would “end up with an ‘over 100 Million’ number. Wow!” — though that figure is next to meaningless.Unquestionably, though, the conversation did (almost necessarily) serve as an antipode to the debate itself. Here was the front-runner for the Republican nomination, a guy who gets more support from Republican primary voters than everyone on that stage combined, engaged in a conversation that one might presume would reveal more about his intentions should he win a second term in 2024. Why wouldn’t people tune in?That presumption about the conversation, though, would not be manifested. This was Tucker Carlson, after all, so the second prepared question was not about policy or Trump’s various second-term promises. It was, instead: “Do you think [Jeffrey] Epstein killed himself, sincerely?”Carlson assured Trump and viewers that he was “not a conspiracy person at all,” an assertion at odds with both that question and his broader track record. But there was a reason that one of his 10 unprompted questions centered on the idea that perhaps Epstein was murdered, an action that would require the involvement of authorities.“The reason I’m asking you is I’m looking at the trajectory since 2015 when you got into politics,” he said. “They started with protests against you, massive protests, organized protests by the left, and then it moved to impeachment twice. And now indictment. I mean, the next stages is violence. Are you worried that they’re going to try and kill you? Why wouldn’t they try and kill you? Honestly.”Trump, who had not agreed with Carlson’s assessment that Epstein was probably murdered, was quick to describe his opponents as “savage animals.” But, once again, he did not agree with the premise, choosing instead to riff on the Russia investigation and the accuracy of the 2020 election, more familiar terrain.So, a bit later, Carlson came back to the idea.“It’s an escalation, is what I’m saying,” Carlson said. “So what’s next? After trying to put you in prison for the rest of your life, that’s not working, so don’t they have to kill you now?”Trump audibly gulped. He again declined to say that, yeah, they were probably going to try to kill him. Instead, he praised his base for sticking with him despite those indictments, which he described using a colorful colloquialism referring to the feces of a steer.But, again, this was the thrust of three of Carlson’s 10 questions: Isn’t the government/the elites/whoever going to try to kill you like they probably did Epstein? In the abstract, it’s a bizarre thing to focus on, this beyond-fringe assessment of the response Trump evokes. (After all, it depends on the idea that the indictments are centered on trying to squelch his power and not, you know, that he might have committed crimes.) Coming from Carlson, though, it’s not really surprising at all.For some time, stretching well back into his tenure at Fox News, Carlson’s presentations were focused on heightening the tension between his viewers (“us”) and the nation’s powerful interests (“them”). He stoked the idea that traditional White Christian conservatives were under threat from all sides — immigrants, the government, medical experts. He cast the nation’s path forward in apocalyptic terms. And so, given an audience with Trump and the audience Trump brings with him, Carlson took the idea of a plot to kill the former president to its extreme.There were other questions, yes. What did foreign leaders think of President Biden? Whom did Trump hope to run against in November? Even, in his next-to-last question, one about his political goals: If reelected, what would be Trump’s number-one priority?And then came Carlson’s last question: “Do you think we’re moving towards civil war?”Trump’s response this time was not reassuring. He noted that there was “tremendous passion, and there’s tremendous love” in the country, then pivoted to praise the crowd who attended his speech outside the White House on Jan. 6, 2021.“People in that crowd said it was the most beautiful day they’ve ever experienced,” Trump said. He added: “I have never seen such spirit and such passion and such love. And I’ve also never seen, simultaneously, and from the same people, such hatred of what they’ve done to our country.”Carlson pressed: Was it possible there would be open conflict?Trump said he didn’t know, adding that “there’s a level of passion that I’ve never seen [and] there’s a level of hatred that I’ve never seen, and that’s probably a bad combination.”And on that note, the interview ended.It’s worth noting that the presented video was edited and published by Carlson, meaning that he chose what to show and what, potentially, to omit. When he interviewed the rapper Ye on Fox News last year, he and his team clipped out a number of Ye’s most antisemitic or otherwise alarming comments, since Carlson was hoping to present Ye as a sober critic of the so-called elite and the powerful. Perhaps this interview, too, was crafted with a specific rhetorical outcome in mind.If so, that outcome was to focus an inordinate amount of attention on the putative risks to Trump personally and to highlight the idea that armed conflict might soon erupt. This was what Carlson chose to accentuate in a conversation that he knew would attract more attention than most of his videos, even if it wasn’t the 100-million-plus listeners that Trump claimed.This discussion of danger and political violence is what Carlson wanted that fervently pro-Trump audience to hear.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/24/tucker-did-his-best-drag-trump-into-his-political-violence-fantasies/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 24, 2023", "Tag": "International political", "Keywords": "Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump, Epstein."}
{"id": 106, "Title": "Without Trump, Republican debate attacks focus on Ramaswamy and Biden", "Description": "Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy is not the front-runner for the Republican nomination, but he emerged as a consistent target of attacks from more experienced politicians during the first Republican debate on Wednesday night.The youngest competitor and millennial outsider was subject to a dozen distinct criticisms from others on the stage, according to a Post tally. Most of the attacks came during notable exchanges with former vice president Mike Pence and former governors Chris Christie and Nikki Haley.Attacks between debate“Vivek, you recently said a president can’t do everything,” Pence said during one tense back and forth. “Well, I got news for you, Vivek. I’ve been in the hallway. I’ve been in the West Wing. A president in the United States has to confront every crisis facing America.”Pence and others critiqued Ramaswamy’s lack of experience and also his positions on U.S. support for Ukraine and his own support for former president Donald Trump.Pence, Christie and Ramaswamy managed to talk most over the course of the two-hour debate, according to The Post analysis, with each holding the floor for more than 11 minutes.How long each candidate spoke for during the first debateThe others, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, struggled to retain the spotlight, tallying less than 10 minutes each of talk time.Trump was not in Milwaukee on Wednesday and was not a central focus of the debate. The front-runner was mentioned by name 18 times by the eight debaters over the course of the night. Even vocal Trump critics did not spend much time attacking him.Attacks on and alignmentsAmong those Trump mentions were shots by Christie at the former president, including: “Whether or not you believe that the criminal charges are right or wrong, the conduct is beneath the office of president of the United States.”Pence and Ramaswamy were the only candidates who mentioned Trump by name in a positive light, with Trump’s former vice president saying he is “incredibly proud of the record of the Trump-Pence administration.”When they were not attacking one another, the candidates focused their critiques primarily on President Biden, whom they hope to unseat next year.Attacks on BidenAmong the topics covered during the debate were foreign policy including Russia, Biden’s handling of the economy and the national debt. Haley, a former U.N. ambassador, mentioned China, Ukraine and Russia more than most other candidates.Mentions of key terms Some candidates may not have another chance to join a debate as the Republican National Committee set a higher bar to qualify for the next one on Sept. 27.Dan Keating and Kevin Uhrmacher contributed to this report.The Washington Post recorded every interaction and reference during the Republican debate and categorized them as a mention, attack or alignment.

{"id": 107, "Title": "Trump gambles on finding strength in indictments instead of debate", "Description": "MILWAUKEE — Less than 24 hours before he surrenders to authorities for the fourth time in five months, Donald Trump and his team tried to send a signal on Wednesday night: No one has a chance to beat him in the GOP primary.As eight other Republicans battled onstage in the party’s first debate here, Trump instead stayed at his New Jersey golf club and said he was too far ahead to worry about debating. His team also tried to project an aura of invincibility, flooding the debate venue with advisers and allies.“I’m leading by 50 and 60 points, and some of them are at 1 and zero and 2 [percent], and I’m saying, do I sit there for an hour or two hours, whatever it’s going to be, and get harassed by people that shouldn’t even be running for president?” Trump said in an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that was released simultaneous to the start of the debate.Whether the strategy to skip the debate accrues in his favor — or matters at all — remains unknown. But Trump’s team has repeatedly deflected questions about 91 felony counts lodged against him, the potential he could face jail time, his 2024 electability and other thorny topics with a similar refrain: We are ahead, in his words, bigly.What his team often says is that Republican voters do not believe he is guilty — or do not care if he is — of committing felonies in his bid to overturn the 2020 election; of illegally mishandling classified documents; of obstructing justice by not returning the documents and asking others to help him keep the documents; of illegally paying hush money to an adult-film star; or of any other charges leveled at him.And they do not exude worries that Republican voters will punish him for skipping the debates, for hitting the trail less than many of his competitors or for attacking fellow members of the party, including popular governors.Only a relatively brief portion of the two-hour debate focused on Trump’s legal problems, which could be a dominating factor for the GOP next year if Trump is the nominee. And the moderators seemed to almost apologize for asking about them — saying they wanted to talk about policy and knew candidates did, but felt compelled to ask the questions.In one of the night’s most memorable segments, moderator Bret Baier called the former president “the elephant not in the room” and asked for a show of hands for who would support Trump if convicted. Investor Vivek Ramaswamy shot his hand up first, eventually followed by everyone except former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Trump’s leading challenger, looked around to see what the other candidates did before raising his own hand.So far, most of Trump’s competitors have been reluctant to criticize him even as they trail him by 30 points or more, afraid of alienating his powerful base in the Republican Party, according to GOP officials and strategists involved in the campaign.In private, they all hope that he will fail — but most of them don’t want to be seen as responsible for helping make it happen. They also all want to narrow the field and separate themselves from other low-polling candidates, and most of the candidates don’t believe hitting Trump helps them do that, GOP officials have said.DeSantis, for his part, was loath to criticize Trump frequently onstage other than obliquely attacking him for empowering former national infectious-disease director Anthony S. Fauci during the coronavirus response and supporting “lockdowns.”Asked after the debate why he did not attack Trump more, DeSantis campaign manager James Uthmeier said the Florida governor “has pointed out things he would have done differently.”Uthmeier demurred when asked repeatedly if DeSantis would be sharper going forward against Trump as he tries to beat him.“He’s said today he’s really focused on the future,” Uthmeier said.Trump, for his part, attacked DeSantis for his performance and for an interview he did on Fox News afterward. “DeSanctimonious was a ‘BOMB’ tonight, especially with his softball interview with Sean Hannity. This guy has totally forgotten his past. Who cares!?!?” he wrote on his Truth Social site.Mike Pence tried to highlight the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and Trump’s efforts to enlist him to overturn the 2020 election — even as other candidates sought to move on — and turned to the camera to tell voters what he believes disqualifies Trump for the presidency.“He asked me to put him over the Constitution, and I chose the Constitution,” Pence said. When Pence talked in the room, there were often groans, audience members said. And he also repeatedly praised Trump’s record as president, when he served as vice president.“Here’s the bottom line: Someone has got to stop normalizing this conduct. Whether you believe that the criminal charges are right or wrong, the conduct is beneath the office of president of United States,” Christie said at the debate.Christie was booed loudly and lustily again when he criticized Trump and he continued, getting booed even louder. The former governor said he did not mind the booing, and his advisers note his popularity has climbed some in recent New Hampshire polls.What attacks there were tended to focus on electability and particular issues where some Republican strategists say he is vulnerable, though it remains unclear if he is.“Trump is the most disliked politician in America,” former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley said. “We can’t win a general election that way.” She also criticized Trump for adding to the national debt. She was booed when she talked about Trump being disliked.In the run-up to Wednesday’s first Republican primary debate, Trump wavered on whether he should attend after all, after loudly proclaiming that he wouldn’t deign to face the rivals trailing him in early polls. Even after taping the interview with Carlson that would be released to counterprogram Fox News’s broadcast, Trump asked associates at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., what he should do and speculated about what the ratings would be.But by the end of the night, Trump’s allies projected confidence that he made the right choice in skipping the debate and belittled the event as a sideshow without him.As it turned out, Trump’s absence led the candidates onstage to spend more time attacking each other than the front-runner. He went largely unmentioned for the first hour — and for much of the second hour — other than a brief segment about Trump’s legal problems.Despite the candidate’s absence, Trump’s campaign established a looming presence at the debate site in Milwaukee. Supporters blanketed the city in signs — many said they had come from Illinois and other nearby states — and Trump’s top advisers stacked up national and local media interviews.His team circulated throughout Milwaukee, conducting hundreds of interviews on his behalf where they repeatedly torched DeSantis. They passed out bingo cards highlighting DeSantis’s verbal tics and perceived weaknesses, and the super PAC supporting Trump created a website calling the debate a “battle for the vice presidency” and inviting users to vote for their “favorite VP.”Other campaigns complained during a walk-through on Tuesday when they learned that Trump surrogates and advisers would be allowed inside the spin room after the debate even though he was not participating in the event. A sign outside some of the entrances said that some Trump aides, including Jason Miller and Justin Caporale, were banned from the venue. The sign included photographs identifying them.Miller said he was stopped but eventually got into the arena, and he accused Fox News of bias against Trump. A spokesperson for the network said it was not responsible for the document and “did not sanction any of the language used.”Trump did not respond to the debate in real time on social media, but his campaign emailed out policy plans corresponding to the topics discussed in the debate, such as abortion and the border.After the debate, Trump’s advisers and surrogates dominated the spin room — an area where candidate advisers and allies make their pitches to reporters. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) called the debate “joyless” and said it was a lot of “has-beens.” The largest press gaggle was the one gathered for Donald Trump Jr. and his fiancée, Kimberly Guilfoyle, who were blocked from entering the official spin room and lambasted Fox News.“It shouldn’t surprise us and it’s also why Trump was 100 percent right not to go to this debate,” Trump Jr. said.Arguably Trump’s greatest act of upstaging was still to come on Thursday, with the former president scheduled to take over the post-debate news cycle with a prime-time surrender in Fulton County, Ga., where he has been charged in an alleged conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results in the Peach State.His team is betting  it can take attention away from the debate with a dramatic flight to Atlanta, where he will turn himself in at the Fulton County Jail.It is a continuing and risky bet that indictments and mug shots will continue to help him with GOP voters. As Trump predicted recently, one more indictment could help him win the nomination.", "Link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2023/08/24/trump-republican-debate/", "ImgLink": "", "PubDate": "August 24, 2023", "Tag": "International political", "Keywords": "1.
